Bitcoin,The Unfortunate Church of Bitcoin,"A lot of skeptics and naysayers often tout how much some maxis treat Bitcoin as a religion. But honestly thats not far off, and it genuinely can stifle adoption -  **but not for the reasons you might think**. Bare with me.

https://preview.redd.it/qnopmmxaqqje1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bffd7c81010c9103f0ca5ff5b883426680804e64

# A Potentially Offensive Oversimplification of Religion

A religion is a deeply ingrained shared belief system. Each shared by up to billions of people worldwide. Something that a majority of us hold due to the *roll of the dice* on what family we were born into and where/when on Earth we were born. A belief system that **very few people** convert away from, because the roll of the dice of their birth placed them into the real religion. Think about how many people a Jehovah's Witness speaks to for each person that convince to convert.

Some people may be born into a family or country with more or less conviction towards their held religions. Take the difference between someone born in some more religious Middle Eastern countries, versus those of Scandinavia, where we can see a new shift in secularity in younger generations.

# A Not Very Tasteful Comparison

I mention this oversimplification, because I want to extend these attributes towards another 'deeply ingrained shared belief system' - **currency**. An economic system that we were born into, have believed in from a young age. One where some where born under the U.S. Dollar, and others, under the Venezuelan Bolivar.

Its commonly said that the fiat currencies we have today, unbacked by precious metals, only hold value because **we all believe** in their value. Irregardless of evidence to back that value, and propped up solely due to our common belief. Of course, that's really what value is though, *right*? We can accept $20 from someone because our belief in the value of that $20, and our extended belief that when we eventually want to spend it, the recipient will also believe in that value as well. Extrapolate that throughout an entire nation, and you have the shared belief system that allows the economy to function.

Some nations, like the religion comparison between the Middle East and Scandinavia, also happen to have their economic belief systems also in different camps. Take the beliefs of those in the United States, which have a (relatively) very strong belief in their currency, to that of Venezuela or Lebanon, whose economic beliefs are on a little shakier of a ground.

Some individuals are much more prone to look for alternatives, and this is why we can see a higher adoption of Bitcoin in these countries with economically shakier foundations. Just like we might consider those more prone to look for alternatives in religion when their current belief system is not providing them with the right answers.

Getting someone to un-learn their economic belief system, one that they have grown up with their entire life, that their family and community uses, and learn about why Bitcoin is a better alternative, is almost akin to trying to convert them from Religion A to Religion B.

# An Somehow Even Less Tasteful Comparison

Imagine, A well dressed man rides up to your house on a bicycle. He knocks on your door and proceeds to try to convince you that the dollars you have spent your life earning, spending, and believing in, are broken. How? Your parents used dollars, their parents used dollars, and even their parents may have used dollars. You get paid in dollars, you purchase food in dollars, **everyone you know and love** **uses dollars for everything**. Sure you have questioned those beliefs sometimes when the bank charged you that crazy fee one time, or when that one restaurant wouldn't accept cash, or even last week when the grocery store decided they wanted to charge way more for eggs. **But that wasn't the dollars problem, that was something else, surely?**

Who does this man think he is, to get you to believe in this currency whose creator we have no proof exists? To switch to a currency that is intangible. How can is be real if you can not hold it?

# The Unfortunate Church of Bitcoin

Unfortunately, this is the state we find ourselves in sometimes. An incredibly difficult 'sell'. To get someone to actually understand Bitcoin, they of course have to **want** to understand Bitcoin, as true with almost anything.

Those that have the easiest time understanding it, are those that can more easily see the flaws in their own economic systems. As I mentioned in a previous post:

>**Necessity is the Mother of all Adoption.**

It's not a good look though, of course. People rightfully can sense when something is a little-too-preachy. And by it's nature, Bitcoin can seem right up that alley due to the things I've mentioned above. **Especially** to someone born in a very privileged economic system.

Bitcoin,Satoshi’s Ingenuity,"I just find it very ironic of everyone who thinks Bitcoin is a useful tool / invention for humanity. The end game for 99% of Bitcoin holders is to get rich. Nothing really virtuous about that. I remember reading Satoshi’s old emails and he had the opportunity to design Bitcoin such that its price remained stable (which would be way more useful) but he foresaw that there would be no adoption. He needed to use people’s natural greed and FOMO to fuel adoption. IMO, he was way more brilliant for that.

Here is the quote from Satoshi responding to Sepp Hasslberger:

“In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”

Bitcoin,Bhutan and Dr. Tenzin,"Hello fellow Bitcoiners,

A quick story about Bhutan, a country that has been quietly mining Bitcoin, which led me to dive deeper into the country. Bhutan measures wealth in happiness rather than GDP, values community deeply, and is the only nation where democracy wasn’t won through revolution but given by the king. To combat brain drain, the king is now developing a ""tech city"" to retain young talent. Just some random, fascinating facts I learned. 

While learning about Bhutan, I came across Dr. Tenzin, a local dentist ([short clip](https://youtu.be/ktct8pvSmug?si=5TwQK0afDzUaN6cX)) working to improve dental hygiene—an issue that deeply affects the population, as many lose most of their teeth by age 50. His efforts to educate and provide care are making a real difference.

If you’re interested in learning more or finding ways to support his work, feel free to reach out to me or Dr. Tenzin/Bhutan Mountain Dentistry directly (I used instagram). Also, for those curious about Bhutan, I highly recommend this [40-minute documentary](https://youtu.be/vMF-mSpynDg?si=e_nkrb4iOuLPPwBh) from DW.

Bitcoin,Sacrifices have to be made for future prosperity,"I’m 25M and been stacking sats since 2024. Started small with 10 dollars a week and slowly felt more comfortable and educated on BTC. I have about .19 now.

I live with my parents, albeit not a great living situation. It’s a 1 bedroom apartment for 3 people and I sleep in the living room. I work 35 hours a week and go to university. My friends find me weird for being old enough to move out, yet they are still being supported by their parents through college with tuition and housing. They tell me to sell my BTC and go travel or move into a new place. Obviously never going to do that. 

This post ties my current life with BTC as I feel like many people in this sub are having difficulties stacking or feel it’s not worth it if you don’t have a full coin. Some are novices and some have been through the bear and bull markets for several years. 

Just wanted this to be motivation and a sense of hope that no matter your living situation and where you are in life, it’s never too late to set your future self up. Don’t try to keep up with societal trends or norms. I may be looked down upon for living in such a small space with parents at my age, but I feel it’s important to have some humility and humbleness in life.

Hopefully someone finds this relatable or motivating to keep pushing yourself to do better. To live in a world where you don’t feel judged by how you live your life, but rather how you change others. 

Big shoutout to my boss for orange pilling me, if he sees this, I give you the upmost respect and I appreciate you for not judging me and giving me a chance.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Scarcity | Analysis for the future,"📉 Key Phases of Bitcoin Scarcity

🚨 2024-2026: The Pre-Halving Liquidity Crisis? 
•	ETF Demand Outpacing Mining Supply 
•	Bitcoin miners currently produce ~450 BTC per day. 
•	Spot Bitcoin ETFs (BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.) are absorbing 3-5x this amount daily—draining exchange liquidity at an unprecedented rate. 
•	If this trend continues, exchange BTC reserves could dry up within 1-2 years. 
•	Long-Term Holders (LTHs) Reducing Circulating Supply 
•	Over 70% of Bitcoin hasn’t moved in a year (Glassnode data), meaning a large portion is locked up in cold storage. 
•	If institutions and sovereign wealth funds continue accumulating, new buyers will struggle to source liquidity. 
•	Retail FOMO & Market Cycles (2025 Bull Run?) •	Historically, retail enters the market after Bitcoin breaks new all-time highs. 
•	A price surge past $100K-$200K could trigger panic buying, further exacerbating supply issues

🔹 Implication: A liquidity crisis is possible as early as 2025-2026—well before the next halving.

🔹 2028-2032: Institutional Supply Shock Begins •	The 2028 Halving will reduce block rewards from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC per block. •	By this time, over 99% of all Bitcoin will be mined. •	Institutional players like hedge funds, ETFs, and sovereign wealth funds will dominate demand.

🔹 Bitcoin could become illiquid, with only small amounts available on exchanges.

🔹 2036-2040: Bitcoin Becomes Ultra-Scarce •	The 2036 Halving will cut rewards to 0.39 BTC per block. •	At this stage, 98% of all BTC will have been mined, making new supply almost negligible. •	Large accumulations will become near impossible for new market entrants.

🔹 Bitcoin may no longer be a freely traded asset but a long-term reserve holding.

🔹 2050 and Beyond: The Era of Satoshis •	By this point, almost all Bitcoin will be in circulation. •	Mining rewards will be insignificant, and BTC will be priced in fractions (satoshis) rather than whole coins. •	Bitcoin may function more like digital gold, rarely transacted but held for wealth preservation.

🔹 Owning a whole Bitcoin will be a status symbol, similar to gold bars today.

🔺 What This Means for Investors •	The real supply shock may begin in 2025-2026, not 2028. •	Institutional accumulation is already reducing liquid supply faster than expected. •	2036-2040 will be the last real window for accumulation before BTC becomes a scarce asset class. •	By 2050, whole BTC ownership will be a privilege, and the market will shift to satoshis.

💡 TL;DR: If you wait for the “expected” Bitcoin scarcity event in 2028, you may already be too late.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Institutional Adoption,"Hi all, just a thought experiment as a bitcoin newbie.

Some have mentioned that if the government views bitcoin as a threat to their fiat. Then they may ban btc (similar to confiscating gold in 1930s). And they can continue printing their shit money. 

However, unlike gold which was easily seized, they can't easily seize btc.

In that case, won't they just ban the institutional adoption of btc, thereby, removing some utility of btc. They can control institutions (fairly easily) but not custody of btc. 

I think of it as people use gold as a store of value because gold can be traded for other stuff (making it valuable). But if btc can't be traded for other stuff, what then would be its use?

Bitcoin,How to make bitcoin transactions more private with liquid network,"Hi guys, if you're using bitcoin and want a simple way to boost your privacy, liquid network is a solid option. the trick is pretty straightforward—you peg in your btc, move it inside liquid where transactions are confidential, and then peg out to a completely new bitcoin address, breaking any link between your original wallet and the final destination.  

first, you need a liquid-compatible wallet like blockstream green or sideswap. you send your btc into liquid, which locks it on the bitcoin blockchain and gives you the same amount in l-btc. inside liquid, transactions are private—nobody can see amounts, only that coins moved. then, when you're ready, you withdraw back to a fresh bitcoin address, making it nearly impossible to trace the connection between your original and new wallets.  

this is an easy way to improve privacy without using mixers or anything too complex. plus, liquid transactions are faster and cheaper than regular bitcoin on-chain transactions. if you want to see exactly how to do this step by step, check out this video where i explain everything: https://youtu.be/gClDxvK-jM0 once you learn this, you'll never look at bitcoin transactions the same way again.",2,8,2025-02-16 16:07:27,BTC,how to make bitcoin transactions more private with liquid network hi guys if you re using bitcoin and want a simple way to boost your privacy liquid network is a solid option the trick is pretty straightforward you peg in your btc move it inside liquid where transactions are confidential and then peg out to a completely new bitcoin address breaking any link between your original wallet and the final destination first you need a liquid compatible wallet like blockstream green or sideswap you send your btc into liquid which locks it on the bitcoin blockchain and gives you the same amount in l btc inside liquid transactions are private nobody can see amounts only that coins moved then when you re ready you withdraw back to a fresh bitcoin address making it nearly impossible to trace the connection between your original and new wallets this is an easy way to improve privacy without using mixers or anything too complex plus liquid transactions are faster and cheaper than regular bitcoin on chain transactions if you want to see exactly how to do this step by step check out this video where i explain everything once you learn this you ll never look at bitcoin transactions the same way again,0.5335378787878788,2025-02-16 16:00

Where do i get actually credible sources of Bitcoin? People are talking so much and i don't know who to believe and why? 

Feel free to share any youtubers you find good or share any book names i should look into. I would be glad to get all the credible informations because it is very confusing.

After reading through many posts, I’m leaning toward this game plan:

Roth Reasoning:
If I want to withdraw Roth funds in 20+ years, ETF will be easier & I don’t have to set up a checkbook LLC & go through that hassle of self custody in my Roth, I could just enjoy the tax free ETF gains. 


2) All Solo 401k funds buy actual BTC that I can self custody since I can hold without needing a checkbook LLC

Solo 401k Reasoning: 
If in next 10+ years, the BTC ecosystem evolves enough where loans against your BTC are common, what’s the point of holding actual BTC in your Roth? I wouldn’t ever sell, just borrow against. Still a non taxable event.

Some thoughts...


######There is no Bitcoin, only UTXOs. 

The term Bitcoin is an abstraction. The underlying system of Bitcoin is extremely complex, involving ledgers, cryptographic signatures, and peer-to-peer networks. For the benefit of the vast majority, however, this is correctly abstracted away:

When you own Bitcoin, what do you have? 

* A wallet with a balance
* The ability to send and receive Bitcoin. [private keys]
* fractional ownership

This abstraction happens at multiple levels:

* Wallet software manages UTXOs automatically
* Simple displays of balances instead of lists of UTXOs
* QR codes for addresses to send/receive

######The money in your pocket is unspent. 

Unspent Transactions [UTXO] are receipts of previous transactions…recorded to the Ledger. They are known as Unspent Transactions because they represent the value of your Bitcoin holdings. Akin to the notes in your wallet.

Your private key enables you to access a certain number of UTXO’s - each assigned a value. When you say you ""have Bitcoin,"" what you actually have are a certain number of UTXOs - recorded on the blockchain - that are spendable by the private keys you control. When you buy Bitcoin you are really buying UTXOs. 

######Transactions Generate UTXOs. 

Assume you control 0.5 BTC. You decide to send 0.3 BTC to an address. Your Wallet uses that 0.5 BTC UTXO as an input and the transactions outputs two new UTXOs:

→0.3 BTC to the recipient
→0.2 BTC back to yourself [your change]

In Bitcoin’s UTXO model - your bitcoin ""balance"" is actually the sum total of all UTXOs that your private keys control. Spend it all and you’ll have zero UTXOs.

Bitcoin,Mysterious Burning Address – 669 BTC Lost Forever 🔥,"Hey everyone,

A few months ago, I came across this **burning address** on Reddit and decided to keep an eye on it to see if more BTC would be sent there. Turns out, the total amount has now reached **669 BTC**, all permanently lost.

**The address in question:**

**1111111111111111111114oLvT2**

(You can check it on Mempool or any block explorer.)

What’s interesting is that **small amounts of BTC keep flowing in**. I was wondering—are these all just intentional “donations” to the void, or could there be another explanation? Could it be automated transactions, old scripts still running, or even people mistakenly sending funds?

But he mentioned something else along the lines of (and forgive any lack of understanding, as the technicalities of such things is still something I’m trying to brush up on):

If we’re in such a scenario, it would be wise to avoid transacting with or transferring any coins. Essentially just pause and let the thing play out.

Bitcoin,Best hardware wallet in YOUR opinion?,"1. Blockstream Jade
2. Coldcard
3. Keystone


Which of these do you think is the best wallet. They are all very solid choices.
Main differences I see:

Open source: Blockstream Jade

Partially open source: Coldcard & Keystone

Air gapped: Coldcard & Keystone

Not fully air gapped: Blockstream Jade


I’d like to hear from as many OG & new bitcoiners in this community, about which of these three do they think is the best. I currently have a trezor 5 but I wanna upgrade to something even more secure. I value security more than anything, I was leaning towards Coldcard but I don’t like how it’s not fully open source. It leaves me a bit uncertain and uneasy knowing that. It’s one of these three that I would like to purchase. Obviously in the grand scheme of things, all 3 are very secure, it’s just me being picky and paranoid.

Bitcoin,Reminder: Binance has locked me out of proposal,"Good evening,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I will tell you my story as it unfolds and will try to remind you to own your keys.

  
Me and my so are living together for the past 5 years already (wow time flies!) and during those 5 years I slowly added small bits of BTC to my ""collection"", for the future.

  
Now, today is the day of love, right? And guess what, I had a perfect plan. To ask her out on a trip. With a little catch. I have bought her a ring 2 months before. Add those two and it's eternal love, watching charts together and growing old. 

  
NOW, that's where the fuck up happened. I've deposited ALL of my 0.7 BTC into Binance so I could pay for the whole trip and have 'backup' reserve in case things go weird. I always do that, I always have a way bigger buffer to feel safe. What if the car breaks down, what if, what if, what if and so on. I preferred that way instead of carrying my trezor with me.

And to my surprise, binance decided that now is the perfect time to do 'routinely review' and lock me out of my account for 'up to 30 days' without telling me a reason right after the deposit got confirmed. 

So now I am shitting my pants (not literally) without any idea on how to fund the trip that I have promised and without any of other savings. I'm laughing between stress attacks. And have no fucking clue what I'm going to do when she is back from work. How to explain it.

  
Not your keys - not your Bitcoin. I've learned this the harsh ways and will probably learn it again tonight.

Bitcoin,‏The Wild Ride That Even Rollercoaster,"Hey r/Bitcoin, 

Ever feel like checking your Bitcoin portfolio is like peeking into a horror-comedy movie? One minute it’s climbing to the heavens like it’s auditioning for a superhero movie, and the next, it’s plunging faster than my hopes on a Monday morning. Lately, Bitcoin’s been throwing more plot twists than a daytime soap opera!

Just this week, after a tweet from that one mysterious crypto influencer (you know who you are), Bitcoin decided to moon—only to do a belly flop moments later. It’s almost as if Bitcoin is in a toxic relationship with stability: it loves the thrill of highs and the agony of lows, and we’re all just along for the ride.

The current events? Imagine if your favorite rollercoaster got a turbo boost and then suddenly the brakes failed. Regulators are poking around like that one friend who always ruins the party, while memes are flying faster than crypto rumors. And amidst all this chaos, we hodlers are here clutching our digital wallets like they’re the last slice of pizza.

So, buckle up, folks. Whether you’re laughing at the absurdity or crying into your coffee, remember: in the wild world of Bitcoin, unpredictability is the only constant. And hey, if nothing else, it gives us endless material for memes and a good laugh at our own expense.

HODL on tight and keep those memes coming!

TL;DR: Bitcoin’s been crazier than ever—part superhero, part tragic love story, and entirely meme-worthy.

Let the rollercoaster continue!

Bitcoin,I built a minimalist Bitcoin notebook to help orange pill the world,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share something I've been pouring my heart into – a minimalist, notebook-style website dedicated to helping people understand Bitcoin: 

[https://satoshinotebook.com](https://satoshinotebook.com)

The project started as my personal collection of thoughts and explanations about Bitcoin, originally meant for orange-pilling friends and family. As it grew, I realized it could be valuable for the broader community.

I am hoping to grow this project into a central resource for people to come in and learn about money and bitcoin. It's also completely open source. I believe in Bitcoin's ethos of collaboration and transparency. If you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, the project is waiting for you on GitHub.

What makes it different:

\- Builds understanding from first principles

\- Beautiful, distraction-free design

\- Bite-sized nuggets of both philosophy and technical details

\- Progressive learning path from basics to advanced concepts

\- Minimalist aesthetic that lets the ideas shine

The site takes you on a journey through Bitcoin's fundamental concepts, gradually building up to more complex ideas. Whether you're just starting out or deeply involved in Bitcoin, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

I built this because I believe that understanding Bitcoin is crucial for our future, and everyone deserves access to clear, thoughtful explanations of why it matters.

Check it out and let me know what you think. I hope it helps you orange pill someone you care about! 

With love,

🧡

Bitcoin,How often put bitcoin in cold wallet,"So I’m new to bitcoin and have about $500 worth of btc so far. I just started this month and I’m trying to do regular purchases of $50-$100 once a week. 

I just got my cold wallet delivered last night and I’m gonna set it up today. My question is, how often should I pull my btc off of the exchange and store it in the cold wallet? I understand to withdrawal the btc I’ll pay a small fee. Is this a percentage or a one time fee. Currently I’m using Coinbase but it is quite expensive so I may switch to strike or kracken once I do some more research. I guess I’m just asking regardless of what specific exchange is being used. 

Should I immediately pull my btc off of the exchange or wait until I have $1000 or so? What is the most efficient and safest way to do this. 

My goal is to continue investing to accumulate.1-.2 btc as my first goal so I won’t be selling/trading at all for a long while if ever. I’m also hoping to have tens of thousands invested over the years so I am not too worried about $50 being locked up for a month or anything like that.

Bitcoin,"Since bitcoin is not controlled by governments, will crime become a bigger issue in the future? What is the future of Government?","This is assuming that bitcoin will trend towards a worldwide adoption in the future. 

Since Bitcoin is designed to be private, doesn't that create a major risk for rampant crime in the future? Evidence of Human trafficking, Drug trade, and Stolen money via monetary transaction monitoring will not be as readily available to Law Enforcement. 

Do you think that governments could gain access to such monitoring of Bitcoin? Perhaps there will be privatized companies that act as enforcers to these crimes, which will serve the Government. 

This also relates to a further discussion about how Bitcoin will affect government in the future. If more of the world adopts Bitcoin and FIAT continues to trend less valuable in the future, will governments continue to exist? Will this create an anarchistic future where government initiatives like education, healthcare etc. supported by taxes disappear?

We have seen that some US states and governments are starting to buy Bitcoin. Could this create an unprecedented restructuring of government based on this new monetary system?

  
Would love to hear your thoughts.

Bitcoin,The future of Bitcoin - supply shock coming?,"600,000 BTC left exchanges last year, reducing available supply by 22%. This could trigger a supply shock, leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or rises. Investors are likely HODLing, reducing selling pressure. Lower exchange liquidity may cause higher volatility. If market sentiment turns bullish, FOMO could push prices even higher. However, macroeconomic factors like regulations or interest rate hikes could offset this effect. Overall, the trend appears bullish for Bitcoin.

If the current BTC outflow of ~50,000 BTC per month continues, a supply shock could become evident by late 2025 or early 2026. At that point, exchange reserves would drop to around 1.58 million BTC, significantly reducing available liquidity. If the outflow accelerates or demand surges, the supply shock could occur earlier, potentially in 2025. This could lead to higher price volatility and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/yFiFeq3.jpeg)",152,111,2025-02-12 21:45:38,BTC,the future of bitcoin supply shock coming 600 000 btc left exchanges last year reducing available supply by 22 this could trigger a supply shock leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or rises investors are likely hodling reducing selling pressure lower exchange liquidity may cause higher volatility if market sentiment turns bullish fomo could push prices even higher however macroeconomic factors like regulations or interest rate hikes could offset this effect overall the trend appears bullish for bitcoin if the current btc outflow of 50 000 btc per month continues a supply shock could become evident by late 2025 or early 2026 at that point exchange reserves would drop to around 1 58 million btc significantly reducing available liquidity if the outflow accelerates or demand surges the supply shock could occur earlier potentially in 2025 this could lead to higher price volatility and upward pressure on bitcoin s price proof,-0.38220925925925925,2025-02-12 21:00

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin becoming centralized in a different way?,"Since MicroStrategy now owns around 2% of all Bitcoin, and other companies are likely to follow in the future, doesn’t this contradict Bitcoin’s original purpose as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency, even if it helps with price appreciation?

I also looked recently into mining, but with energy costs and competition rising, it’s already very hard for individuals to participate without spending more than they earn. At the same time, if corporations and institutions keep accumulating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than using it, doesn’t that create a new form of centralization? Instead of a few entities controlling the monetary system like in traditional finance, we could end up with a few corporations controlling a significant share of Bitcoin.

Of course, some will argue that Bitcoin remains decentralized because of the blockchain itself, because no one can change the rules, seize funds, or censor transactions. But if a small number of companies control a large percentage of the supply, doesn’t that still give them disproportionate influence over the market and adoption?

Yeah, I’m personally invested in Bitcoin and see the benefits, but I’m curious how do you view this trend?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation,"I’ve always thought of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation—fixed supply, no central bank printing more of it, etc. But I’ve noticed that whenever inflation numbers come in *higher* than expected, Bitcoin tends to *drop* instead of going up.



Shouldn’t higher inflation make Bitcoin more valuable? Instead, it reacts more like a risk asset, selling off along with stocks when inflation runs hot. I get that interest rates and liquidity play a role, but if Bitcoin is really an inflation hedge, shouldn’t it be doing the opposite?



Is this just a short-term thing, and Bitcoin’s inflation-hedge role only plays out over a longer time frame? Or does this mean Bitcoin isn’t really an inflation hedge at all—at least not in the way people think?

Bitcoin,BTC Lending Question,"
Starting off with and example..

Bank has the only $100 in circulation. Person A makes bet with Person B. Person A loses, doesn’t have the money and goes to the bank to borrow the only $100 in existence at 10%. Where does the 10% come from if there is only $100 in circulation. How would you pay back the interest?

Traditional banking would just print it. But what if you can’t print it, you know, in the case of Bitcoin? 

If there was $200 in existence, you’d have to provide enough value to the other entity with $100 to acquire the 10% or $10 to pay back the interest… who ever is earning interest on the money ends up with all the money (just how it has always been)... 

The next question is, how do you safely lend Bitcoin for interest? Can it be done on layer II? Where it’s off chain paper essentially? Wouldn’t this create a derivatives market around Bitcoin? What would this look like?

Bitcoin,How do we prove that the market manipulation is happening,"So a lot of analysts that I am aware of believe that bitcoin and crypto in general is undervalued right now in relation to a lot of the news and national accumulation by various countries. 

The fact that the price isn’t pumping they say is due to manipulation of the market but the sceptic in me thinks that using manipulation as a scapegoat for why the price isn’t going up is an easy way to create a boogie man that most people can’t prove.

I know that obviously the Blockchain is public but if it was that easy to just spot the manipulation going on surely everyone would know and it wouldn’t work.. 

So my question is and bearing in mind I am relatively new to crypto (2/3yr lurker) are there other ways to prove this market manipulation and answer the question of whether or not it’s happening and therefore gain more accurate view of the value of bitcoin and crypto. 

Or am I just asking to predict the future..

Bitcoin,Why using your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan is the worst idea ever,"So there is a lot of talk in here and various other spaces online about, ""Never sell your Bitcoin, use it as collateral to get a loan out."" Reasoning behind it has been so you don't pay capital gains taxes and also get to retain your Bitcoin.

Currently live in Australia and have done research on this as an option and I have found it to be a very lacking and risky option.

We had companies like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi to name a few where a lot of people lost their Bitcoin that was posted as collateral and have not been reimbursed. For current lenders like Ledn, the collateral you have to post is double what you get back in a loan, plus you pay like a 15% interest rate on it and they rehypothecate your Bitcoin most likely and so there is massive risk of another Celsius/BlockFi collapse happening.

There are no traditional banks with insurance that offer loans with Bitcoin as collateral, in fact they do not care about Bitcoin. Also, even if they allowed it you would still have to give up custody of your keys to get the loan in the first place and are we really, as Bitcoiners going to entrust a third party with our BTC? Have we all lost the point of BTC?

Also you would not be able to service the interest repayments on the loan because having the collateral isn't good enough, you also need to have income (separate from selling Bitcoin to pay for the loan) in order to qualify for a loan in the first place. 

So I don't know how any true BTC maxis in here would recommend this as an option but every third comment I have seen is ""Never sell your Bitcoin, get loans out against it"" and as we can see that is a complete BS option.

I have not had one person comment who has actually gotten a loan out against their BTC, no one has done it, because it's a ridiculous idea.

Personally, I would rather take the 15 to 22% capital gains tax hit on selling some Bitcoin for spending, compared to giving the entire Bitcoin to some random company and getting a tiny loan back (which has to be paid back + interest) and then maybe if they don't collapse you'll get your Bitcoin back at the end of that. NO THANKS.

Are there good loan options out there?",180,168,2025-02-12 11:50:31,BTC,why using your bitcoin as collateral for a loan is the worst idea ever so there is a lot of talk in here and various other spaces online about never sell your bitcoin use it as collateral to get a loan out reasoning behind it has been so you don t pay capital gains taxes and also get to retain your bitcoin currently live in australia and have done research on this as an option and i have found it to be a very lacking and risky option we had companies like ftx celsius and blockfi to name a few where a lot of people lost their bitcoin that was posted as collateral and have not been reimbursed for current lenders like ledn the collateral you have to post is double what you get back in a loan plus you pay like a 15 interest rate on it and they rehypothecate your bitcoin most likely and so there is massive risk of another celsius blockfi collapse happening there are no traditional banks with insurance that offer loans with bitcoin as collateral in fact they do not care about bitcoin also even if they allowed it you would still have to give up custody of your keys to get the loan in the first place and are we really as bitcoiners going to entrust a third party with our btc have we all lost the point of btc also you would not be able to service the interest repayments on the loan because having the collateral isn t good enough you also need to have income separate from selling bitcoin to pay for the loan in order to qualify for a loan in the first place so i don t know how any true btc maxis in here would recommend this as an option but every third comment i have seen is never sell your bitcoin get loans out against it and as we can see that is a complete bs option i have not had one person comment who has actually gotten a loan out against their btc no one has done it because it s a ridiculous idea personally i would rather take the 15 to 22 capital gains tax hit on selling some bitcoin for spending compared to giving the entire bitcoin to some random company and getting a tiny loan back which has to be paid back interest and then maybe if they don t collapse you ll get your bitcoin back at the end of that no thanks let s have a discussion am i right or wrong am i missing something are there good loan options out there,-0.02039283435862383,2025-02-12 11:00

Bitcoin,How can I explain the security of Bitcoin wallets to my friend?,"My friend saw that I made a big profit from Bitcoin. He decided to talk to me and sincerely advised me to withdraw all my money as soon as possible because he believes Bitcoin could drop to zero at any time.

He convinced me that since I don’t understand how Bitcoin wallets work, I don’t actually own my wallet, and that someone else could completely access it anytime, anywhere without my permission. According to him, Bitcoin is nothing but a massive scam designed to lure people like me into investing more and more money before everything collapses. Then they will take all the money.

He explained how someone could easily access a wallet at random and that I could lose my money just as easily.

I responded, **""That’s true, but they’d have to find the exact wallet among a 'near-infinite' number of wallets.""**

Bitcoin,Bitcoin 2500: A Space-Age Op-ed,"Many of us here share the thought that Bitcoin is the *end-game of money*; that Bitcoin will be for the next 5000+ years what gold was for the previous 5000.

Only five centuries ago, settlers began to venture across the Atlantic to *the new world.* I wanted to go through a little thought experiment into what Bitcoin will look like just five centuries from now, in the **year 2500**. A future where humanity has spread across the solar system, with settlements on Mars and beyond. **There are many issues that Bitcoin faces in this future**. Does Bitcoin succeed? How would it differ from the Bitcoin of today?

This post will deal a little more with the technical aspects and logistics of a multi-planetary Bitcoin network, so strap-in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the inability to double-spend coins; the ability to rely on the blockchain as a source of truth. This hinges on the **security and synchronicity** of the blockchain. 

This works fantastic on Earth, as communications across the globe happen near instantaneously - *even at the speed of light*. However, that's not the case when we begin to think about distances in space. The time it takes for light (and any communication) to travel between Earth and Mars ranges from [3 to 22 minutes](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html) depending on where within our respective orbits each planet is. Between Earth and some of the promising moons of gas giants like Europa? over [45 light-minutes](https://spacecenter.org/meet-the-solar-system-europa/#:~:text=Europa%20is%20one%20of%20Jupiter's,45%20minutes%20to%20reach%20Europa). Let's not even get into interstellar space, where travel to the nearest star system is over [4 years away at light-speed](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html).

>**Why is a delay in communication an issue for Bitcoin miners?**

Imagine that you are part of the future colony on Mars and you want to mine Bitcoin. You quickly realize it is impossible. In fact, **mining Bitcoin anywhere other than Earth is impossible.** Why? Because it doesn't matter how fast your mining machines are if you are solving blocks too late. And as mentioned earlier, at 3-22 light-minutes away, Mars' distance from Earth is far enough that you can be multiple blocks behind *at light speed.* 

[No Earthly pool would accept your miner's hashes](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/from-rejected-to-accepted-tips-for-improving-your-mining-speed) if you are providing the solutions to those hashes a potential **44** minute round-trip later. 

In order for Martian Bitcoin miners to contribute meaningfully, a Mars-based mining pool would be one that can successfully compute enough blocks in the communication gap to outpace the Earth miners, thus having the longer and valid chain. *But wait!* This means that Mars would have successfully 51% attacked the blockchain. So let's not do that, and find another solution.

>**A potential space-age solution to Bitcoin mining.**

Because of the issues that arise with the speed of light, mining Bitcoin in the future will potentially need to be centralized in respect to location. It will be difficult for computers more than a few light-minutes away to meaningfully contribute valid hashes to the network. In fact, *your hash-rate's value scales linearly towards zero as your approach 10 light-minutes away*.

* **0 light minutes away?** Amazing, you can contribute to the network in near real-time and you have the full (approximate) 10 minutes to find the next block's solution.

* **5 light minutes away?** It's feasible to mine, except *your hash-rate is worth half as much* as someone that is 0 light minutes away. Why? because you have approximately half as much time to solve the block in the 10 minute space.

* **10 light minutes away?** Your hash-rate is essentially *worthless* because you will always be attempting to solve an old block. 

This is all theoretical of course, because if you are dealing with mining real estate at the light-minute scale, the energy usage of that compute would be astronomical - *literally.* 

One solution to this energy usage is a hypothetical megastructure known as a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere). An entity that would provide more than enough usable energy for such an endeavour, and it also would be localized enough to enable connected miners to meaningfully contribute to mining.

Maybe a [Kardashev Type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a little far fetched for our civilization in the year 2500, but anything is possible.

> **What issues would Bitcoin users face?**

Let's revisit that previously mentioned colony on Mars, and instead imagine someone wishes to send you one million sats via L1, the base chain.

How would you perform this transaction so that you can trust it? What if that Bitcoin is sent to a different recipient on Earth at the exact same time as it is sent to you on Mars, and you have no way of knowing for an entire block?

Well, it turns out that **we've already solved this problem on Earth** \- *to an extent.* All that you would need to do is wait for a certain amount of confirmations in order to ensure that your coins were not double-spent and that you are the rightful recipient. This solution works well on Earth, and can even potentially work on Mars.

Although this band-aid solution wont work forever. Those closest-neighbour star systems mentioned earlier are still **4+ lightyears away.** And we can't expect someone in the Proxima Centauri system to wait over 200,000 block confirmations for their transaction, right?

>**A potential solution for space-age Bitcoin users.**

Layers upon layers. That's it really. It's quite obvious at this point that 600,000 transactions per day (the limit of Bitcoin's base chain) can't support hyperbitcoinization tomorrow, let alone in 500 years when our population has continued to grow in size and in distance. 

It may be that each individual civilization has their own layer built upon the blockchain, and that transactions between civilizations must be settled on the basechain as a result. Mars may very well have their own rollup solution, wherein martian settlers are free to transact indefinitely between themselves - *their own lightning network*. Periodically settling back and forth between the main chain to top-up as needed. In this instance, you could accept that previously mentioned 1 million sats from your fellow settler easily because you need not be wary about a double-spend back on Earth, since it is agreed upon by the network that those sats are within your own layer, removing any light-speed communication issues.

>**Why does any of this even matter?**

It's very obvious that alternative stores of value will be worth much less in the distant future. Precious metals are found in abundance within asteroids in our solar system, and there are already ventures that aim to one day harvest these minerals. What value will precious metals have if we are able to capture a [single asteroid worth $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000](https://www.space.com/psyche-metal-asteroid-composition)?

**Physical store-of-value assets become worthless in an age of such abundance**, and thus Bitcoin, as a truly scarce digital asset will reign supreme. These aforementioned smaller logistical hurdles will just need to be resolved before then.

As I mentioned in a previous Op-ed on this sub, it's important for us to try to envision future problems that might arise with Bitcoin, irregardless of how far away they are. If we want to build a future-proof, resilient asset, we can not just be concerned with what issues may arise in the next decade. There are investors today that view Bitcoin as a cross-generational asset for themselves and their families. 

I wrote about this topic very briefly in my [Bitcoin 2048 Op-ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ijhcth/btc_2048_hyperbitcoinization_oped/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but it was a lot of fun envisioning Bitcoin in the far-future that I wanted to explore this idea more in depth.

Bitcoin,Sometimes Compromise is Necessary RE: Bitcoin,"I've attained a .2 btc stack in the last four years, in dribs and drabs.  I know it's not much, but I'm proud of it.  But I have three kids and want each one to have .2 btc each.  So I need another .4 before it skyrockets.

The wife has been with me on my stacking thus far.  Not really into it but letting me play since it's my money and I support the family well.  But... when I told her I wanted to take out a 40K loan to get the other .4, she balked.  No way, she said.  I'm crazy, she said.

So I told her, then if you'll let me take out 50K so I can get up to .7, then when it hits 500K I'll sell off a .16 to get all our money back and pay off the loan.

Leaving my kids with .54 (.18 apiece instead of .2).

Yeah I wanted them each to have a .2, but compromise is important in a marriage.

SHE SAID YES.  She still rolled her eyes but she said yes.  That woman is a Godsend.

Bitcoin,Bitcoiners are the most prepared individualists for the potential economic collapse,"*I made this post in r/singularity I think it is relevant here too.

**Jobs, Automation and Debt**

The argument is simple, the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt, student debt, mortgage, credit card debt and the list goes on. With technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods.

The effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008. It will be the great economic depression of this century. People can't repay the debts, banks collapse, and with that all the economy. The question is where is the line, 10% unemployment of knowledge workers, 15%, 20%?

With the collapse of the banks, as was in 2008, bailouts once again will be approved. By bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away, which eventually leads to hyperinflation.

So, mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation. Which means collapse of the dollar/euro.

This is the transition period, and it is going to be hard. I really much hope I am wrong, but the logic says otherwise.",4,32,2025-02-11 12:42:24,BTC,bitcoiners are the most prepared individualists for the potential economic collapse i made this post in r singularity i think it is relevant here too jobs automation and debt the argument is simple the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt student debt mortgage credit card debt and the list goes on with technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods the effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008 it will be the great economic depression of this century people can t repay the debts banks collapse and with that all the economy the question is where is the line 10 unemployment of knowledge workers 15 20 with the collapse of the banks as was in 2008 bailouts once again will be approved by bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away which eventually leads to hyperinflation so mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation which means collapse of the dollar euro this is the transition period and it is going to be hard i really much hope i am wrong but the logic says otherwise,-0.34814122807017545,2025-02-11 12:00

Bitcoin,Help me understand,"I'm in the process of DOYR and i'm trying to really understand from a technical POV the technology. I have a decent knowledge and i have an engineering degree that allows me to be comfortable with the Maths behind btc. After browsing through many forums i can't wrap my head around the collision problem:
I'm trying to understand how one could ""steal"" bitcoin from an unknown wallet.
Here is what i understand:

-There are 2e256 private keys

-There are 2e160 addresses associated (160bit hash result) Therefore there are 2e96 private keys for each public address
1rst problem: if i send btc to one of these addresses: will 2^96 wallets recieve it?

2nd problem: why do some people claim that you only need to bruteforce 2e160 adresses to succesfully ""steal"" btc as finding an adress is useless
My understanding is that you would have to brute force 2e256 keys to find one (actually less bcs of birthday paradox) because the only way of being able to manipulate btc is through the private key.

But it is so much greater than that. This is just the amount of hashes that happens per second. Let's extrapolate a little further.

If each block requires approximately 10 minutes of compute to find a solution, that means it takes approximately 600 seconds of this network hashrate to find a solution. That's over **600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** hashes to find one single solution, or **6\*10\^23** **hashes.**

How big is this number? Well the number of stars in the entire observable universe is on the order of **7\*10\^22** **stars.**

>**Every single block added to the blockchain is protected by more individual calculations than the number of stars in the entire known universe by a factor of ten.**

Ok, lets do the hail Mary. How many hashes have ever been calculated for the Bitcoin network? Well using [historical Bitcoin hashrate charts](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) and a little bit of calculus, it's easy to get a quick estimate!

As of February 2025, **5.45\*10\^28** **hashes have been approximately computed by miners since the dawn of Bitcoin.**

That's 54.5 Billion Exahashes, 54.5 Million Zettahash, 54,500 Yottahash, or **54.5** [**Ronnahash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)**.**

This is approximately the same amount as the observable universe is wide. ***in centimeters*****.**

Bitcoin,Suggestion? Or just following the trend?,"I have been here for a while and I have seen many people being driven by emotions in discussions about Bitcoin, especially when prices are rising. Some people may make overly optimistic statements in this craze, encouraging others to ""buy in"" and ignoring the uncertainty of the market. Such behavior is essentially irresponsible speculation, but lacks in-depth analysis of the market and real help for novices, misleading novices to follow the trend and suffer serious losses.



I have found in some posts that some people may advocate that the price of Bitcoin will inevitably continue to rise, or predict that there will be huge profit opportunities in the future. Such statements can easily mislead newcomers who are not familiar with the market, especially those who use Bitcoin as a tool to get rich quickly and ignore its risks.



Others are too aggressive in the forums, boasting that Bitcoin is the ""ultimate currency"" of the future, and completely ignoring or simplifying real-world challenges such as regulatory issues, scalability, environmental impact, etc. While Bitcoin is indeed innovative, it is irresponsible to over-exaggerate its potential without mentioning its limitations.



For novices, it is important to understand the potential of Bitcoin while also understanding its limitations and risks in order to make wise decisions.



Regardless of personal investment goals and risk tolerance. As a high-risk asset, Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone to invest in, especially for novices who do not have sufficient knowledge and experience.

Bitcoin,Is Trump’s Crypto Pivot Actually a Trojan Horse for the U.S. Dollar?,"So, I’ve been thinking… now that Trump is embracing crypto, I don’t think that it’s for altruistic reasons. Considering his resent actions in the world, If I were him, I’d see crypto as a massive opportunity to **suck value back into USD** not as some ideological move that benefits the masses.

Here’s my theory:

1. **Trump pumps the market, then sells on the public** – By signaling pro-crypto policies, he drives hype, institutions FOMO in, and retail follows. Meanwhile,the U.S. accumulates reserves, only to sell later, securing gains in USD.
2. **A “Strategic Reserve” isn’t about buying and holding like Gold—it’s about controlling** – If the U.S. accumulates Bitcoin or other crypto assets, it can **sell at peaks**, absorbing liquidity back into the dollar. Think of it as a national-scale arbitrage game.
3. **Crypto as a tool to balance U.S. debt?** – With trillions in national debt, creating an environment where capital flows into crypto **only to be cashed out into USD-controlled channels** could be a way to reinforce dollar dominance. Look at how Trump is securing stable coins in USD. If enough global wealth moves into crypto, the U.S. can indirectly control its flow.
4. **A bull run under Trump, followed by a liquidity exit?** – Imagine this: A massive crypto rally, institutions buy in, retail piles in… then, a strategic dump occurs. 

This isn’t about decentralization or freedom. it’s **market psychology weaponized for economic leverage**. What if Trump sees crypto not as an alternative to the dollar, but as a tool to **reinforce it** by soaking up excess global liquidity?

Bitcoin,Sparrow with Blue Wallet watch only,"I've my coldcard Q set up with sparrow and all is fine. 

I wanted to be able to view transactions on mobile so I set up a watch only wallet via blue wallet.

My question is my seed isn't exposed or anything this way? This is just a test set up to make sure all is ok before I set up my main accounts etc. 

Basically, I'll be travelling for a few months and I want to be able to buy BTC in strike app (like I'm already doing) and just send it over to sparrow cold storage and be able to see the updates via blue wallet without having to open up the laptop to check sparrow.

Bitcoin,I have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102,"Hey,

I've been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff, and I just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that I want an answer for, but before my question I just want to link this from the wikipedia:

**""Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $487 in 2023) per troy ounce.""**

What if, US government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices, that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind? Can't they make another executive order for let's say Microstrategy, that either all their shares, or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the US government, either for free, or for some fee such as the current market price. 

I understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings, especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut, but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their BTC holdings, what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like MSTR to forfeit all the bitcoin to the US government?

I'm not the best at explaining and asking stuff, but I hope you guys understand where I'm going with this, like don't people like michael saylor or companies such as MSTR with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin, since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end?",1,0,2025-02-10 10:51:53,BTC,i have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102 hey i ve been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff and i just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that i want an answer for but before my question i just want to link this from the wikipedia executive order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before may 1 1933 all but a small amount of gold coin gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the federal reserve in exchange for 20 67 equivalent to 487 in 2023 per troy ounce what if us government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind can t they make another executive order for let s say microstrategy that either all their shares or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the us government either for free or for some fee such as the current market price i understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their btc holdings what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like mstr to forfeit all the bitcoin to the us government i m not the best at explaining and asking stuff but i hope you guys understand where i m going with this like don t people like michael saylor or companies such as mstr with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end,0.49906923076923076,2025-02-10 10:00

Bitcoin,Question about Range Trading & Best Wallet,"# 1) Range Trading

Most of my assets I want to keep for at least a year. But I got a bit tired watching my Cryptos go up and down constantly - and I'm guessing smo is making profits out of this...  So I am thinking to take a small portion to try out Range-Trading.

E.g. in the current phase buy BTC at 97k Sell at 102k. When at some point theres a bigger push, find a new support & resistance level and continue the scheme.

Who has experience with this and what tips can you give?

# 2) Getting a Wallet

So far I've been holding on Kraken. If I'd start range trading there I'd first sell the coins I first bought = highest taxes. So I want to put all my assets in a wallet, that ideally allows me to choose the assets based on time I bought them for trading (LIFO).

a) Which wallet?

Looking for a safe, easy to use affordable wallet. Smo recoomend Ledger Nano X Does that make sense for my use case? Other suggestions and why?

b) Where to trade cheapest

Obviously for this to work, the fees and spreads have to be good. Kraken is ok - but maybe theres a better way?

c) Safety

Bitcoin,Still feel awkward to display affinity towards bitcoin in public,"

However, i recently bought a copy of ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ and started reading it but i am uncomfortable reading it with its cover on display on public transport. 

I find it weird that after all these years, and so much mainstream acceptance for bitcoin, i still find it awkward to display my affinity to bitcoin coin in public. I feel people will judge me - for something not sure what.

Bitcoin,Old wallet.dat file recovery,"Back in 2013 I bought one single bitcoin worth about 11.92 at the time on my family’s old desktop. As the years went on however the old bitcoin core wallet was completely deleted off the computer by one of the other family members. After all these years with the recent price of bitcoin I became a lot more interested on trying to recover the old wallet data. I decided to use a file recovery software(DMDE) and was able to recover a lot of .dat files from there. I then formatted the wallets and used py wallet with a bash script to recover both the secret phrase and an ENCRYPYTED key from the recovered wallet.day file. Here’s where I’ve became extremely stuck

I’ve been searching all over the internet trying to figure out how I can even attempt to unencrypt the file. I’ve tried using multiple python scripts to attempt the recovery but none were successful, am I doing something wrong here? 

I also have been struggling and wondering how I’ll even import a private key if I’m able to ever unencrypted the file itself.

I was wondering what are the best steps I should do from here with an overall in-depth answer. If possible that is.

What I do have -
The wallet.dat file that was recovered 
The encrypted key from that file

I try a first transaction of 0.1 BTC all fine, after that I convince myself to do everything in a transaction..... after 1h my swap was still pending, after a while I write to support la my swap is blocked asking me for KYC.

I decide to complete the KYC, I didn't have much other choice, thinking they would unlock my funds but nothing.

Ok so 1 oz if gold is right now valued at 42.22 dollar. But the current price is 2900 market.
So (2900-42.22)= 2857.88 per oz (30gram)

2857,88÷30×1000x8134000=774866530666,6 dollar.

CryptoCurrency,ETH lagging behind in bull market?,"Hi guys, 

Recently I've been thinking about setting up an automatic DCA into BTC. But I noticed BTC is quite high at the moment while ETH remains behind for now at pretty stable levels. Would it be lucrative to allocate some to ETH considering the current proportions in valuation?

I've always had some degree of trust in BTC so its easier for me to possibly commit to DCA'ing, but I just look at the chart for ETH and I see more upside potential in the short term than BTC. Not based on anything but purely chart motions and peaks/lows.

Is it wise to consider allocating a portion to ETH, or has ETH lost its shine somewhere along the way? I remember gas fees being so high it made me reluctant to even use ETH back in the day. ETH was always the odd one and had some struggles rising up in valuation, but I do see practical use cases even though I don't like the gas fees. I like to keep a balanced portfolio and I'm feeling like buying BTC at ATH while ignoring ETH hovering around midrange is imprudent.

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs—this is Jack’s mother’s birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum—this is Jack’s birthday.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi’s email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi’s connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist’s famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack’s pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack’s company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright’s attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

CryptoCurrency,Is Crypto Nullifying Safe Gambling?,"Every day, as part of my career in the crypto casino space, I see more and more no-KYC casinos popping up. At first, it’s easy to see the appeal obviously, instant sign ups, total anonymity, no verification waiting times. Just deposit your crypto and start playing. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder: is this actually a good thing?

These casinos, despite being licensed in various jurisdictions, don’t ask for ID, proof of age, or any personal details. That means literally anyone with crypto can deposit, gamble, and withdraw their winnings with zero true oversight. That includes minors, problem gamblers, and even people looking to use these platforms for malicious reasons. And yet, people celebrate this as a feature, not a flaw or at least something we should keep an eye on, if not even intervene somehow. 

I get the privacy argument. Nobody wants to hand over sensitive personal data to a company they barely trust. We’ve all heard horror stories of leaked databases, identity theft, and government overreach. And let’s be real, traditional online casinos are a bureaucratic nightmare when it comes to withdrawals. Not just from a KYC POV but also from a payout time POV. KYC delays, frozen accounts, endless document requests—it’s frustrating. So, I completely understand why people want no-KYC casinos and it’s only crypto that seems to be able to offer that right now. 

But here’s where it gets dark for me at least:

Underage gambling – A 15-year-old with access to Bitcoin or USDT can gamble with ease. No ID, no questions asked.

Problem gambling – Without KYC, there are no self-exclusion programs, no deposit limits, no real way to intervene if someone is spiraling into addiction.

Financial crime risks – Crypto already has a reputation for being used in money laundering. No-KYC casinos make it even easier to move funds under the radar.

So, where do we draw the line? Should privacy take full priority, even if it means opening the doors to these risks? Or should the industry find a middle ground such as maybe allowing small transactions without KYC but requiring verification for larger amounts? Some casinos are already exploring this hybrid approach. Is that the best way forward for the industry? Keep both parties equally only half-happy?

I’m really curious about what others think. Are no-KYC casinos a step toward financial freedom, in the sense of giving you control of your identity— even when  it comes to A CASINO, or are they a ticking time bomb for responsible gambling?",8,31,2025-02-16 03:33:51,BTC,is crypto nullifying safe gambling every day as part of my career in the crypto casino space i see more and more no kyc casinos popping up at first it s easy to see the appeal obviously instant sign ups total anonymity no verification waiting times just deposit your crypto and start playing but the more i think about it the more i wonder is this actually a good thing these casinos despite being licensed in various jurisdictions don t ask for id proof of age or any personal details that means literally anyone with crypto can deposit gamble and withdraw their winnings with zero true oversight that includes minors problem gamblers and even people looking to use these platforms for malicious reasons and yet people celebrate this as a feature not a flaw or at least something we should keep an eye on if not even intervene somehow i get the privacy argument nobody wants to hand over sensitive personal data to a company they barely trust we ve all heard horror stories of leaked databases identity theft and government overreach and let s be real traditional online casinos are a bureaucratic nightmare when it comes to withdrawals not just from a kyc pov but also from a payout time pov kyc delays frozen accounts endless document requests it s frustrating so i completely understand why people want no kyc casinos and it s only crypto that seems to be able to offer that right now but here s where it gets dark for me at least underage gambling a 15 year old with access to bitcoin or usdt can gamble with ease no id no questions asked problem gambling without kyc there are no self exclusion programs no deposit limits no real way to intervene if someone is spiraling into addiction financial crime risks crypto already has a reputation for being used in money laundering no kyc casinos make it even easier to move funds under the radar so where do we draw the line should privacy take full priority even if it means opening the doors to these risks or should the industry find a middle ground such as maybe allowing small transactions without kyc but requiring verification for larger amounts some casinos are already exploring this hybrid approach is that the best way forward for the industry keep both parties equally only half happy i m really curious about what others think are no kyc casinos a step toward financial freedom in the sense of giving you control of your identity even when it comes to a casino or are they a ticking time bomb for responsible gambling,-0.07479546485260773,2025-02-16 03:00

I'm looking for a way to accept small tips and donations from users in my community  
I will probably make a Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee account, but those services only accept fiat money via stripe, cashapp, paypal... and I know some people don't like to use those and would prefer sending a tip in crypto (well known crypto that are easy to deal with and widely accepted, so bitcoin ethereum and monero)

So I've looked online for a tipping platform like those 2 but with crypto, but I can't find anything useful, not even a reddit post talking about the idea, which I find really weird

The ONLY thing I've found is this website called ""cwallet"", but it seem fishy as hell, the website itself look like something big and professional, but except the website itself, there is absolutely no info about it online, no one talking about it on reddit or any other forums

So I'm asking all of you here, is there such a thing as a platform where you can receive tips in crypto that redirect them to your wallet ?

Please it have to be something SIMPLE like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee

I know I could simply give my wallet address directly or a QR code and tell people to donate there, BUT I want to offer small compensation for the tips like special roles and customisation on discord, so I need the person tipping to be able to send a small message with their username with the tip

I also know that ultimately I could make a webage with a crypto paiement tool, something where you select the amount you want to give, it generate a QR code for the right amount to my wallet, it allow people to enter a small message that I would receive by mail or something, and the system check the blockchain to see if the paiement is real and once it's confirmed it send the mail with the confirmation + the user's message...  
But this is faaaar beyond what I can do...

Thanks for your help :)",16,15,2025-02-15 16:54:53,BTC,tipping system like ko fi or buy me a coffee but with crypto hi i m looking for a way to accept small tips and donations from users in my community i will probably make a ko fi or buy me a coffee account but those services only accept fiat money via stripe cashapp paypal and i know some people don t like to use those and would prefer sending a tip in crypto well known crypto that are easy to deal with and widely accepted so bitcoin ethereum and monero so i ve looked online for a tipping platform like those 2 but with crypto but i can t find anything useful not even a reddit post talking about the idea which i find really weird the only thing i ve found is this website called cwallet but it seem fishy as hell the website itself look like something big and professional but except the website itself there is absolutely no info about it online no one talking about it on reddit or any other forums so i m asking all of you here is there such a thing as a platform where you can receive tips in crypto that redirect them to your wallet please it have to be something simple like ko fi or buy me a coffee i know i could simply give my wallet address directly or a qr code and tell people to donate there but i want to offer small compensation for the tips like special roles and customisation on discord so i need the person tipping to be able to send a small message with their username with the tip i also know that ultimately i could make a webage with a crypto paiement tool something where you select the amount you want to give it generate a qr code for the right amount to my wallet it allow people to enter a small message that i would receive by mail or something and the system check the blockchain to see if the paiement is real and once it s confirmed it send the mail with the confirmation the user s message but this is faaaar beyond what i can do thanks for your help,0.5146738095238095,2025-02-15 16:00

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the FIRST month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **JAN Highlights:** Mixed month, but overall up.  **XRP** nabs the monthly lead followed by **SOL**.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+323% vs S&P500's +766% - see below for details).

# Month One – Up +7%

https://preview.redd.it/trx8sjru1bje1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcfb2b9a3a84d8b1c7bb96218ff95a1873cf86e5

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

January highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **SOL** lead the way
* Mixed month, but gains outpace losses 

# January Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bzr1catv1bje1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634081a2542903b9d2017dd280b0afdae59a6e9

# January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **XRP** (+38%) easily took the monthly victory followed by **SOL** (+20%)

***January Losers*** – **AVAX** (-5%) and **BNB** (-4%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: A mixed but mostly green start to the year

In contrast to [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), this year is off to a fairly good start (the 2024 Top Ten portfolio was down -14% after one month).

**XRP** is out to an early lead (up +38% in January) followed by **SOL**, +20% so far in 2025.  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** thirty days ago is worth $138 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio gained $66 (+7%) in January so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$1,066.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later: 

https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a

**January Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7% 
* **COIN50**: +3%

The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**

https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc

**That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hbnt3pe22bje1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ca9d18c0995634af7a64b2d7b23b71313f9a5

In summary: ***That’s a +323% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

Not a bad start to the year for crypto, we’ll see what 2025 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.   

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  January’s extended report is on the [OG 2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85).

CryptoCurrency,The Changing Face of Crypto Security: Why Trust Matters More Than Ever,"The crypto space in 2024 has been rollercoaster. We have seen Bitcoin cross the $100,000 mark, a market wide bull run and even politicians like Donald Trump talking about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. It finally feels like crypto is breaking into the mainstream in a way we have all been waiting for.   
  
But with all this growth, there's been a darker side too. According to Chainalysis, over $2.2 billion was lost to hackers in 2024 alone, a 21 percent jump from the previous year. Every week, it seems like there is another story about an exchange getting hacked or a project turning out to be a scam. It’s a harsh reminder that while crypto is evolving, so are the bad actors looking to take advantage of it.   
  
This is why picking the right exchange has never been more important. It’s easy to get caught up in hype, but when your money is on the line, security and trust should come first.   
  
What Forbes Crypto Exchange Rankings Tell Us   
  
Forbes recently put out a list of the 25 most trustworthy exchanges, ranking them based on regulation, transparency, security and financial strength. Some of the names on the list were predictable. Binance, Bitget, coinbase and Bitstamp all made the top 10. These are massive platforms with millions of users, so seeing them ranked highly isn’t surprising.   
  
I remember when I first started trading, I didn’t think too much about security. I just wanted to find an exchange that was easy to use and had the tokens I was interested in. But after seeing so many scams and hacks over the years, I have learned that where you trade is just as important as what you trade. Exchanges that prioritize security, proof of reserves and regulatory compliance are the ones that will last, and they are the ones worth paying attention to.

CryptoCurrency,"The Age of Crypto: Where Are We Now, and What Comes Next?","Crypto has gone through distinct eras, each one shaping the industry’s evolution. If we zoom out, where exactly are we in the grand timeline of this technology?

Let’s break it down.

#🌀 Phase 1: The Genesis Era (2009 - 2013)

📜 The Bitcoin Creation Myth

Bitcoin launches (2009): Satoshi Nakamoto drops the Bitcoin whitepaper, mining begins, and a few cypherpunks take notice.

The First Transactions (2010): 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. Bitcoin’s first real-world value is established.

Mt. Gox rises & falls (2011-2013): The first major exchange, the first major hacks, the first crypto boom and bust cycle.

Altcoins emerge (2011+): Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin—the first experiments in differentiating from Bitcoin.

🔹 Theme: ""Digital gold, magic internet money, early speculation.""

🕰 Where we were? Cypherpunks and libertarians playing with an experimental financial toy.

#⚡ Phase 2: The Smart Contract Revolution (2014 - 2017)

🧠 From Money to Programmable Finance

Ethereum launches (2015): Vitalik Buterin introduces smart contracts—now blockchain isn’t just money, it’s a decentralized computing platform.

ICO Mania (2016-2017): Ethereum fuels an explosion of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with millions raised in minutes (and scams rampant).

Bitcoin splits (2017): Blocksize wars → Bitcoin Cash hard fork → BTC’s ossification begins.

Ethereum’s ""World Computer"" vision gains traction, but scaling issues arise.

🔹 Theme: ""Programmable money, decentralized apps, the rise of Ethereum.""

🕰 Where we were? Wild West fundraising, the birth of altcoin culture, and the first big questions about Bitcoin's ability to adapt.

#🌊 Phase 3: The DeFi & NFT Explosion (2018 - 2021)

🎢 Crypto Goes Full Casino

DeFi Summer (2020): Decentralized finance (DEXs, lending, yield farming) explodes on Ethereum—billions locked in smart contracts.

NFT Mania (2021): JPEGs selling for millions, celebrities launching NFT projects, mainstream brands entering crypto.

Ethereum congestion crisis: Gas fees skyrocket → Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon) rise to fix scaling.

Bitcoin stagnation vs. Ethereum innovation: The debate intensifies—BTC maximalism vs. the rise of multi-chain ecosystems (Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, etc.).

🔹 Theme: ""Decentralized casinos, JPEG speculation, and the first real DeFi boom.""

🕰 Where we were? Crypto was both a joke and a revolution, with real applications but also extreme speculation.

#🧩 Phase 4: Institutionalization & The AI Convergence (2022 - 2025)

🏛 Wall Street Enters & AI Merges with Crypto


Ethereum transitions to Proof of Stake (2022): The biggest blockchain upgrade ever, PoW is left behind.

Bitcoin ETFs launch (2024): The traditional finance (TradFi) floodgates open—BlackRock, Fidelity, and institutions jump in.

Crypto & AI Merge (2024-2025): Decentralized AI marketplaces, blockchain-powered AGI models, AI agents running on-chain economies.

Regulation hits hard: The SEC, global governments, and centralized exchanges fight for control.

🔹 Theme: ""Crypto enters the real economy, AI-driven automation begins.""

🕰 Where we are? The transition from crypto as speculation to crypto as infrastructure.

#🚀 Phase 5: The Age of Autonomous Economies (2026 - ?)

🤖 Smart Contracts Evolve into Self-Sustaining AI Agents

AI-driven DAOs: Decentralized organizations fully run by AI, governing treasuries and executing transactions without human input.
AGI + Blockchain = Self-Learning Systems: Blockchain-based AI models that evolve, train, and operate independently.
Decentralized Compute: GPU & compute markets move on-chain, replacing centralized AI models like OpenAI & Google DeepMind.
Nation-State Adoption: More countries adopt crypto as legal tender, governments issue CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to compete.
Hyper-Bitcoinization? Or PoS Supremacy? The battle between Bitcoin’s ossification and smart contract-driven economic layers intensifies.

🔹 Theme: ""Autonomous on-chain economies, AI + Crypto fully merges, digital nations emerge.""

CryptoCurrency,I have created a website that provides visualizations of transaction-speed/time-to-finality for different cryptocurrencies. Would love to know your thoughts.,"[https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/](https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/)

I created this website to have place to compare how fast different cryptocurrencies take to fully confirm a transaction. Cryptocurrency settlement times, or time-to-finality, are essential to understand. They tell you how long it takes for a cryptocurrency transaction to be verified and considered irreversible on the blockchain.

For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use probabilistic finality, confirmations are about reducing the probability of a transaction reversal. Each confirmation means more blocks are added to the chain after your transaction, making it increasingly difficult to alter. While absolute certainty is never reached, the chance of reversal becomes astronomically low with each confirmation. Bitcoin, for example, commonly uses 6 confirmations, with each block taking roughly 10 minutes, to reach a very high level of confidence in transaction finality.

However, not all cryptocurrencies work this way. Some, like Nano, offer deterministic finality. Here, a ""confirmation"" signifies a definitive agreement within the network, achieved through different consensus mechanisms. Once confirmed in a deterministic system, the transaction is considered absolutely final and irreversible.

It's important to differentiate settlement-time/time-to-finality from Transactions Per Second (TPS) and Blocks Per Second (BPS). TPS measures how many transactions a network can process per second, representing its transaction throughput. BPS, on the other hand, measures how many blocks are added to the blockchain each second, reflecting the rate of block creation. While a high TPS network can handle more transactions, and a higher BPS can increase the rate at which the blockchain grows, neither directly dictates settlement time/time to finality. The two are related but distinct concepts.

If any info on this website is incorrect i welcome your feedback, its hard to give a set time for settlement/finality for each crypto since it also depends on the state of the networks, and their consensus mechanism, but with this website i try to give an approximate number.",72,33,2025-02-12 21:15:05,BTC,i have created a website that provides visualizations of transaction speed time to finality for different cryptocurrencies would love to know your thoughts i created this website to have place to compare how fast different cryptocurrencies take to fully confirm a transaction cryptocurrency settlement times or time to finality are essential to understand they tell you how long it takes for a cryptocurrency transaction to be verified and considered irreversible on the blockchain for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which use probabilistic finality confirmations are about reducing the probability of a transaction reversal each confirmation means more blocks are added to the chain after your transaction making it increasingly difficult to alter while absolute certainty is never reached the chance of reversal becomes astronomically low with each confirmation bitcoin for example commonly uses 6 confirmations with each block taking roughly 10 minutes to reach a very high level of confidence in transaction finality however not all cryptocurrencies work this way some like nano offer deterministic finality here a confirmation signifies a definitive agreement within the network achieved through different consensus mechanisms once confirmed in a deterministic system the transaction is considered absolutely final and irreversible it s important to differentiate settlement time time to finality from transactions per second tps and blocks per second bps tps measures how many transactions a network can process per second representing its transaction throughput bps on the other hand measures how many blocks are added to the blockchain each second reflecting the rate of block creation while a high tps network can handle more transactions and a higher bps can increase the rate at which the blockchain grows neither directly dictates settlement time time to finality the two are related but distinct concepts if any info on this website is incorrect i welcome your feedback its hard to give a set time for settlement finality for each crypto since it also depends on the state of the networks and their consensus mechanism but with this website i try to give an approximate number,0.47978838383838385,2025-02-12 21:00

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin’s Security Model is Dying – Proof of Work Was a Brilliant Start, But It’s Time for Proof of Stake","(*This isn’t FUD—just an honest discussion about Bitcoin’s future and the evolution of blockchain tech.*)  

Bitcoiners love to talk about **""digital gold,""** but there’s a fundamental flaw:  
✅ **Gold doesn’t become less secure over time.**  
❌ **Bitcoin does.**  

Bitcoin’s security depends on **miners**, but miner incentives **shrink every 4 years** as block rewards halve. Eventually, **miners will rely 100% on transaction fees**—and that’s an **untested experiment.**  

Meanwhile, **Proof of Stake (PoS) is the logical evolution of Proof of Work (PoW)**—achieving the same security goals **without burning entire countries’ worth of electricity**.  

---

### **🔋 PoW Was a Brilliant Bootstrapping Mechanism—But It’s Outdated**  

🔹 Proof of Work was a **genius solution** to kickstart blockchain security.  
🔹 It worked because miners had to **commit real energy**, making early attacks costly.  
🔹 But today, it’s **wasting insane amounts of electricity** just to **maintain artificial scarcity**.  
🔹 **PoS does the same job, without the waste.**  

Bitcoiners argue that PoW secures the network, but **at what cost?**  

- Bitcoin currently consumes **as much electricity as Argentina.**  
- This energy is **used to generate artificial digital scarcity.**  
- The security model **breaks down** over time, as block rewards disappear.  

And here’s the **real killer issue**:  
👉 **Every 4 years, Bitcoin’s price must double, forever, to keep miners paid.**  
👉 Eventually, the network will be supported by **only a few users paying insane fees.**  

🚨 **How expensive would Bitcoin transactions get if miners relied 100% on fees?**  
- Bitcoin can only handle **~3-7 transactions per second.**  
- Miners currently earn **~$50M/day** in rewards and fees.  
- If they ONLY relied on fees, **each transaction would need to cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.**  

👉 **Who is paying $1,000 per Bitcoin transaction?** A handful of whales? A few settlement banks?  
👉 That’s not a **usable** network—that’s a **hyper-centralized ghost chain.**  

---

### **💡 Proof of Stake: The Next Evolution of Blockchain Security**  

Ethereum **realized PoW was outdated** and made the transition to **PoS**. Why?  
✅ **It still provides strong security**—by slashing validators who act dishonestly.  
✅ **It doesn’t waste electricity**—it secures the chain without environmental destruction.  
✅ **It’s more sustainable long-term**—no need for continuous exponential price increases.  
✅ **It allows for more scalability**—since it’s not bottlenecked by mining limits.  

Bitcoiners dismiss PoS, but ask yourself:  

🔹 If Bitcoin were launching today, **would it use PoW?**  
🔹 Or would it use **a modern, energy-efficient security model?**  
🔹 Why should Bitcoin stick with **a 2009 technology** when **better options exist?**  

👉 **PoW is like the horse-drawn carriage.** It was great for a while, but we don’t need to ride horses anymore when we have **EVs and bullet trains.**  

---

### **🔮 Bitcoin Needs a Fix—Or It Will Eventually Die**
The **only way** for Bitcoin to remain secure **forever** is to add a **tail emission**—a small, permanent block reward to keep miners incentivized.  

✅ **This would allow Bitcoin to remain digital gold.**  
✅ **It would keep mining sustainable and incentivize cheaper energy production.**  
✅ **It would prevent Bitcoin from collapsing under its own weight.**  

But the **social contract** is:  
❌ **Bitcoin is ossified.**  
❌ **No major changes are allowed.**  
❌ **Even discussing tail emissions is heresy.**  

So what happens?  
🚨 Eventually, incentives **break down.**  
🚨 Maybe in **one halving**—maybe **several halvings from now.**  
🚨 But long before **2140**, Bitcoin miners will not be making enough.  

And what happens then?  
- Fees become **insanely high**.  
- Users **move to other chains**.  
- Miners **start shutting down**.  
- Security **collapses**.  

At that point, Bitcoiners will **have no choice** but to:  
1️⃣ Add tail emissions (inflation) to save the network, or  
2️⃣ Watch Bitcoin become **a weak, fee-dependent ghost chain.**  

---

### **🔥 Final Thoughts: The Best Way to Understand Blockchain? Start with PoW, Then Move to PoS**
PoW **is the foundation**—it’s how you learn about blockchain’s fundamentals.  
🔹 **If you want to understand blockchain, start with Bitcoin.**  
🔹 **If you want to understand the future, study Ethereum and Proof of Stake.**

CryptoCurrency,The self-fulfilling prophecy of halving cycles have accelerated and stunted this cycle’s bull market.,"Coupled with the cooldown of a tech heavy stock market, which has a lot of crypto-invested investors, we are going to see the first market crash caused by a crypto crash, and not the other way around.

Liquidated longs in crypto will lead to liquidated longs in NVDIA, vice versa and the cycle will repeat until Btc hits 55k. This will happen before May.

 BTC will then see a resurgence, leading to an eventual actual alt-season which will end around October. 

BTC will top out at 150k-200k.

The “dip” will be caused by fears around new trading alliances being have to be built up due to the aggressive policies of the current US administration.

CryptoCurrency,Why I won't sell ETH,"Too many times have I sold crypto because of ""fear"", and historically speaking I would have been way richer if I would have just bought and hold my 5 BTC.

ETH is still the leading chain when it comes to smart contracts, and this first mover advantage will not go away, look at BTC, which is the best example for first mover advantage. Additionally, with the updated ETH, the network will become faster and cheaper, and even more reliant. No other chain is as reliant as ETH for smart contracts.

If ETH is going to 0, then all other alt coins will go down as well. It is the 3rd most traded coin and 3 times more than 4th place, meaning there is no head-on-head-race going on at all! Measuring on market cap, its place 2.

CryptoCurrency,"The crazy world of crypto, It's only getting worse","  
Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

CryptoCurrency,Why Everything Positive You've Heard About Crypto Is a Trick,"
When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To understand why, let’s first clarify what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can provide direct benefits to people. Wheat itself stores the potential to provide that benefit. It stores value because it holds that potential. The number ""500"" is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number, the greater the potential.

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar has the potential to fulfill people's need to pay debt. Every dollar in existence enters circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars. Individuals and businesses need them, and the U.S. government needs them.

Just as biology creates the need for food, the banking system creates the need for dollars through loan contracts, collateral, and government bonds. Debtors must acquire dollars to settle the obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store the potential to satisfy that need. The dollar itself stores value because it holds the potential to provide what is needed by the debtors in the U.S. banking system. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of that potential to benefit debtors. The number '500' is simply a measure of this potential. The greater the number, the greater the potential.

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you hold a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. They store value because they hold the potential to provide benefits to people. The more units of these digital goods you hold, the more benefits you can provide.

In the above examples, we saw what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value: it means holding something with the potential to satisfy people's needs and provide a direct benefit.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. Crypto systems don’t have warehouses where they store wheat or any tangible goods. They don’t produce music, e-books, or software. They don’t issue loans, take collateral, or deal with government bonds.

What crypto systems do is assign numbers to addresses and record those assignments in a decentralized digital ledger. That’s literally it. This means that when you hold a number in your wallet, you don’t own the potential to satisfy people's needs or provide any benefit to them. All you do is hold a number.

If you hold the number 1, your potential to provide benefits to people is zero. If someone else holds the number 1,000,000, their potential is not a million times greater than yours; it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to provide benefits to people. That’s why, by holding crypto, you don't own an asset or a store of value. And you certainly don't own money or currency, since those actually store value. Simply put, you hold a number but own nothing.

Crypto holders, recognizing they own nothing, resort to spreading false or misleading narratives in a desperate bid to offload their numbers and acquire assets. One such false narrative is about scarcity. For instance, they point to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap and call it scarcity. But scarcity applies to things that satisfy needs or provide benefits. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is nothing that can satisfy people's needs; there's nothing to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of numbers assigned to addresses.

An example of a misleading narrative is the supposed simplicity and speed of crypto. This is often touted as one of its appealing qualities, but the reality is that crypto is fast and easy precisely because it doesn't manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Take wheat, for example: it requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars, too, involve a complex web of processes, from assessing creditworthiness to drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because managing something that actually provides benefits to people is far from simple or easy.

In contrast, crypto systems only track which number is assigned to which address. And tracking numbers? That’s straightforward and easy.

Another false narrative is that value is belief-based, that something is valuable if people believe in it, and if they don't, it's not valuable. But belief cannot change the potential of something to satisfy people’s needs. Wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition, and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks, regardless of what anyone believes. That stored potential is value. The claim that value is based on belief is just another trick crypto holders use to mislead people into giving up assets in exchange for numbers.

No matter how many narratives crypto advocates spin, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Everything positive you’ve ever heard about crypto is just a trick to get ownership of your valuable assets and dump numbers on you.",0,34,2025-02-11 10:38:14,BTC,why everything positive you ve heard

potential of something to satisfy people s needs wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks regardless of what anyone believes that stored potential is value the claim that value is based on belief is just another trick crypto holders use to mislead people into giving up assets in exchange for numbers no matter how many narratives crypto advocates spin the fundamental fact remains they hold numbers but own nothing everything positive you ve ever heard about crypto is just a trick to get ownership of your valuable

CryptoCurrency,"Nasdaq Files to List XRP ETF, Stating XRP Is Hard to Manipulate","Article in summary:
Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

CryptoCurrency,"Cboe BZX submits filings for XRP ETFs from Bitwise, WisdomTree, Canary, and 21Shares.","Looks like the hype for xrp is gonna huge this bull run. 
Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.

CryptoCurrency,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

CryptoCurrency,I have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102,"Hey,

I've been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff, and I just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that I want an answer for, but before my question I just want to link this from the wikipedia:

**""Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $487 in 2023) per troy ounce.""**

What if, US government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices, that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind? Can't they make another executive order for let's say Microstrategy, that either all their shares, or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the US government, either for free, or for some fee such as the current market price.

I understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings, especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut, but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their BTC holdings, what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like MSTR to forfeit all the bitcoin to the US government?

I'm not the best at explaining and asking stuff, but I hope you guys understand where I'm going with this, like don't people like michael saylor or companies such as MSTR with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin, since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end? I'm a firm believer of self-custody and I had this question for the people that own MSTR stock, like ""what if? not your keys not your coins, right?""

No longer will BTC drop 5x -25x from top to bottom allowing you to 5x -25x your money if you play the cycles. The jig is up, there are no new retailers bc everyone is onto the cycle theory, everyone knows this. The ETFs will provide a price floor. So by moving to ETFs, he is saying, without saying that there is may not be anymore cycles to play.  Is this good or bad, I am not smart enough to figure that out. If it is TRUE and the cycles are very reduced (say we only drop to 70k from here for the bear), the ONLY way BTC goes up is new money.

CryptoMarkets,Why Are Some of the Best Crypto Projects Still Overlooked?,"It’s interesting how some projects seem to be making real progress under the radar while others dominate headlines just off hype. I’ve been looking at different metrics, TVL growth, real adoption, network upgrades, and it’s clear that some ecosystems are quietly getting stronger without making much noise.



Take EOS, for example. It had a reputation for years as an ""old"" project, but if you actually check the numbers, it’s been making serious moves. TVL is near an all-time high, adoption is increasing, and the latest upgrades (like the Antelope Spring update) have improved efficiency and tokenomics. It’s even part of the Coin50 Index, which tracks the strongest smart contract platforms in the market, and it’s currently the second-best performer in that category.



But despite all that, it’s not a name you see constantly hyped on CT or Reddit. Maybe it’s just because newer projects steal the spotlight, or people still associate it with the past, but I feel like narratives shift fast in crypto. We’ve seen it before—Solana was “dead” in 2022, and now it’s everywhere again.



Another one I’ve been keeping an eye on is Kaspa (KAS). It’s been flying under the radar but has a unique approach with its blockDAG structure, allowing high-speed transactions while maintaining decentralization. Unlike a lot of L1s, it doesn’t rely on gimmicks—it’s pure proof-of-work but with a design that solves a lot of Bitcoin’s scaling issues. The adoption is slow but steady, and if you look at its trajectory, it feels like one of those projects that could explode when the market catches on.



What other projects do you guys think are building quietly while the market focuses on the same handful of names?

They had to do this in order to get a large loan from the IMF.

Why the IMF had that requirement is anyone's guess, though we could probably make a pretty good one.

They don't want anything like bitcoin catching on and replacing their seat at the table.

CryptoMarkets,XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality,"
The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. The countdown to the approval of several spot XRP ETFs has begun.
The SEC has just given a green light to Grayscale’s proposal for a Spot XRP ETF by officially acknowledging the 19b-4 filing submitted via NYSE Arca—and now they’re calling on the public for feedback. In the filing posted last Thursday, the commission set a 21-day deadline for comments after the notice hits the Federal Register. Once that window closes, the SEC will decide whether to give this ETF the thumbs-up, knock it back, or even open up formal proceedings.

This 19b-4 filing is a crucial second step in launching a spot XRP ETF. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the regulatory process really kicks into gear.

Recently, a slew of crypto ETFs—from Solana to Dogecoin—have been on the SEC’s radar as firms test the waters for regulatory approval.

The Crypto Thaw
This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. Gensler was famously skeptical, often labeling most cryptocurrencies as securities. In contrast, the agency has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and later, spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a more welcoming environment for digital assets.

Asset managers including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to XRP without the hassle of holding the coin. This isn’t just a clever piece of financial engineering—it’s a potential game-changer that bridges the gap between traditional Wall Street and the fast-moving crypto frontier.

These filings are more than just regulatory checkboxes; they’re statements of intent. The idea is to democratize access to XRP, inviting both retail investors and institutional titans to partake in what many see as the next big chapter in crypto history.

Today the SEC acknowledged Grayscale and the NYSE’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF.  It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for. 

xrp price prediction

XRP ETFs are close to approval wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X

Green Light Soon?
The SEC’s nod to the XRP 19b-4 filings isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox—it’s a pivotal move in the ETF approval saga. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it clearly shows that the wheels are turning. If, and when an XRP ETF does eventually get the green light, we could be staring down the barrel of a major institutional investment wave, one that’s likely to boost liquidity and demand significantly.

With regulatory clarity inching closer and Ripple making bold strides on the global stage, we have to ask: Are we on the verge of witnessing XRP’s metamorphosis from a mere utility asset into a bona fide mainstream financial instrument? If so, this isn’t just evolution—it’s a revolution that could upend traditional investment paradigms. XRP to the moon.

A Shifting Regulatory Landscape
With pro-crypto President Trump in charge, and new SEC chair Paul Atkins at the helm—whose track record hints at a more open-minded approach to digital assets—the stage is set for XRP ETF applications to clear the regulatory hurdle.

This potential pivot isn’t just about XRP—it’s emblematic of a broader transformation in how regulators might handle digital assets. For contrarians like us, it’s a fascinating development. While some fear that regulatory embrace could water down the decentralized ethos of crypto, others see it as the inevitable maturation of a market that’s been too raw for too long.

Market Impact: Bulls Charging, Bears on Alert
The ripple effects of these ETF applications could be huge. Analysts are already speculating that if approved, these ETFs could inject between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets into the XRP ecosystem within the first year. That’s not chump change—it’s a tidal wave of capital that could drive XRP’s price and liquidity to new heights. That means XRP price predictions for 2025 will have to be adjusted higher. As you can see on the XRP price chart below, the XRP price moved 4% higher on today’s news.

CryptoMarkets,Why I’m bullish on COMP,"
1. It has a hard cap of 10 million, making it a hard store of value. 

2. Even after its recent bubble which tripled its value from $41 to $139, it has landed at $56 which is still a 27% increase if you have been holding long term. 

3. It has the additional utility for earning interest for lending if you choose to use it for that purpose. 

4. It is accessible via apps like Coinbase, Kraken, or Robinhood making it easier for new investors to get in & for its market cap to grow.

5. With its supply limited to 10 million, & its low price per unit of $56 current, it has more room to grow than other cryptocurrencies like BTC which has hard cap of 21 million & a price per unit that has been hovering around $100,000.

In other words, is it highly likely that investors will leave bitcoin and go into cardano (for example) and then cardano would have the trillion dollar market cap and bitcoin would go to zero?

CryptoMarkets,Don’t over leverage yourself!,"I see it in this space all the time. New people or some times experienced people over leverage themselves and lose more money than they can afford.

It’s not the most popular advice to give, but if you need money for rent or for groceries don’t put it into crypto. Most of the posts about “full proof trading strategies” or “easy 100x gains on X coin” are usually scams or just flat out lies.

If you are new, don’t put in more than you can afford to lose. Look at coins with proven track records. Bitcoin isn’t the coolest crypto out there but it’s one of the safest. For example 90% of my holdings are in Bitcoin, 5% is in SOL and ETH, the rest is with projects I like or for gambling.

DCA is your best friend. Throwing everything into a coin all at once is another easy way to lose money. Don’t buy into the “ape culture”.

If something seems too good to be true it usually is. Slow organic growth is not a bad thing. Stay safe and play it smart, nobody truly knows what the market will look like tomorrow or the next day but crypto will continue to grow so don’t waste your hard earned dollars being impatient. Don’t get caught up on how much other people made off their crypto trades, most of it is luck.

When looking at the monthly returns for bitcoin, February tends to be one of the best.

Right now it is flashing red, which it does do sometimes, but it's not very often.

The more likely scenario is that bitcoin tends to bounce later this month and ends the month green yet again.

If we look at the 4 year cycles, it usually has a very good month during the 4th year... which is right now.

For newbies, back in 2022, Stronghold was accused of hiding issues with contracted suppliers, missed deadlines, and difficulties in obtaining new mining equipment. In March 2022, their financial reports revealed losses higher than they had claimed during their IPO a few months earlier. 

As a result, $SDIG fell, and investors filed a lawsuit alleging they were misled about Stronghold’s mining capacity, operational costs, and the feasibility of expanding its mining fleet during its IPO.

The good news is that the company finally agreed to pay investors $4.75M + 25 BTC over this whole situation. The deadline is a few weeks ahead. So, if you were an investor back then, you can check the details and file for payment [here](https://11thestate.com/cases/strongholddigital-investor-settlement).

btc,State of market,"So I was inspired by another post and went on ChatGPT and asked him to make an analogy between the wall street cheat sheet and the actual status of btc chart.

If we compare the current BTC chart with the Wall St. Cheat Sheet – Psychology of a Market Cycle, Bitcoin seems to be somewhere between “Complacency” and “Anxiety.”

Explanation:
	1.	Complacency: BTC has experienced a massive rally in recent months, reaching 100k USD. Many investors might believe this is just a “small pullback” before another rally, exactly as the chart describes: “We just need to cool off for the next rally.”
	2.	Anxiety: As BTC fluctuates between 92k-100k, some investors are starting to worry: “Why am I getting margin calls?” and “This dip is taking longer than expected.” If BTC drops below 92k, it could confirm this phase.
	3.	Risk of Entering “Denial” and “Panic”: If the market continues to correct and falls below 85k-90k, many investors might enter the Denial phase, convincing themselves that “BTC is solid, it will bounce back,” while reality could be a continuation of the decline.

If the bull market continues, we could move back into the “Thrill” and “Euphoria” phases. But if a deeper correction happens, we could see “Panic” and “Capitulation.”

Conclusion:

BTC appears to be in the “Complacency-Anxiety” zone, and the next few weeks will determine whether the rally continues or if we enter a deeper correction phase.

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs—this is Jack’s mother’s birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum—this is Jack’s birthday.

May 3, 2010: Satoshi’s last mined block—this is Jack’s father’s birthday.


Dorsey's Bitcoin Connections Post-Satoshi Disappearance

Jack’s San Francisco address was 2 Mint Plaza (jD2m)—he later sent Bitcoin to addresses containing ""jD2m.""

Satoshi tells Martti Malmi he is ""busy with work""—Jack was busy launching Square (now Block).

December 5, 2010: Satoshi advises against donating Bitcoin to Wikileaks.

December 14, 2010: Twitter receives a secret court order to turn over information about Wikileaks.

December 13, 2010: Satoshi disappears.

March 28, 2011: Jack becomes Executive Chairman of Twitter while still CEO of Square.

April 23, 2011: Satoshi sends his last email.

May 23, 2011: Twitter’s tech lead suggests Bitcoin integration.


Jack's Public Relationship with Bitcoin

September 2012: Jack calls Bitcoin an ""amazing movement"" and suggests Square will adopt it if widely accepted.

2013: Alyssa Milano, Jack's best friend, releases Hacktivist, a novel featuring a protagonist living a double life behind a pseudonym.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi’s email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi’s connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist’s famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

2018: Square releases a children's book about the ""Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,"" where Satoshi resembles Jack.


Recent Jack Dorsey & Bitcoin Connections

April 20, 2020: Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi—Jack coyly replies he wouldn’t admit it if he were. Unlike Szabo, Back, and Finney, Jack never outright denies it.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack’s pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack’s company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright’s attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

The bot generates a personal wallet for you, which is great for security, but also means no one else should ever have access. If I let someone else use it, I might as well just hand them my private keys.

btc,A project for all of us,"BTC is losing its principal values due to the market manipulation, the big whales, trump, elon...

This is not what satoshi created BTC for.

We all should organize against this

Im looking for serious blockchain and smart contract developers, to make the protect im attaching below.

Whitepaper: BTC Community Staking Protocol (BCSP)

Introduction

The BTC Community Staking Protocol (BCSP) is a decentralized protocol designed to organize the Bitcoin holder community and reduce the circulating supply, generating a positive impact on its price and stability without whale manipulation. Unlike traditional staking systems, BCSP does not allow whales or centralized entities, ensuring an equitable distribution and 100% decentralized governance.

2. Problem

Currently, the cryptocurrency market is dominated by large investors ('whales') and entities that manipulate BTC cycles. Small and medium holders lack organization and power over the BTC supply, leading to:

Price instability.

Loss of trust within the community.

Dependence on speculative trading rather than long-term holding.

Solution: BTC Community Staking Protocol

We still got the mayority of btc but wont last much more with the institutions and big whales playing the game. More than half of the existing btc are in ''small'' hands, in plenty of wallets.

3.1. BTC Locking with On-Chain Transparency

Holders can lock their BTC in smart contracts for defined periods (e.g., 2, 5, or 10 years). Information about the locked BTC will be public, allowing the protocol's strength and its impact on reducing circulating supply to be demonstrated.

3.2. Incentive for Holders: $BTCU Token

To reward those who lock BTC, a native token, $BTCU, is issued based on the amount of BTC locked and the staking duration. The issuance of $BTCU is limited and deflationary to ensure its long-term value.

Distribution of $BTCU:

1 BTC locked for 2 years ➞ 100 $BTCU

1 BTC locked for 5 years ➞ 250 $BTCU

1 BTC locked for 10 years ➞600 $BTCU

Gradual distribution: Tokens are released progressively according to the lock duration to prevent market dumping.

3.3. Decentralized Governance (DAO) BCSP will be managed by the community through a DAO system, where $BTCU holders can vote on key decisions:

Changes in staking parameters.

Use of potential development funds.

Implementation of new features.

3.4. Liquidity and Flexibility

To avoid liquidity loss for holders:

Locked positions can be traded on a secondary P2P market.

$BTCU token can be used in DeFi as collateral on decentralized lending platforms.

Security and Regulation

BCSP will be 100% decentralized and intermediary-free, with:

Audited smart contracts to ensure security.

Open-source code, allowing community verification.

No fixed return promises, only incentives based on real supply and demand.

Roadmap

Phase 1: Development of the smart contract and testing on the testnet.

Phase 2: Launch of the protocol and initial staking.

Phase 3: Implementation of DAO and decentralized governance.

Phase 4: Expansion of integrations with DeFi platforms.

Phase 5: Global growth and mass adoption.

Conclusion

The BTC Community Staking Protocol is the first initiative to unite BTC holders in a collective effort, free from whales and institutional manipulation. The combination of transparent staking, well-designed incentives, and decentralized governance could mark a turning point in the crypto ecosystem, making us(the mayority) the ones with the control over it and not them.",0,5,2025-02-10 02:42:47,BTC,a project for all of us btc is losing its principal values due to the market manipulation the big whales trump elon this is not what satoshi created btc for we all should organize against this im looking for serious blockchain and smart contract developers to make the protect im attaching below whitepaper btc community staking protocol bcsp introduction the btc community staking protocol bcsp is a decentralized protocol designed to organize the bitcoin holder community and reduce the circulating supply generating a positive impact on its price and stability without whale manipulation unlike traditional staking systems bcsp does not allow whales or centralized entities ensuring an equitable distribution and 100 decentralized governance 2 problem currently the cryptocurrency market is dominated by large investors whales and entities that manipulate btc cycles small and medium holders lack organization and power over the btc supply leading to price instability loss of trust within the community dependence on speculative trading rather than long term holding solution btc community staking protocol we still got the mayority of btc but wont last much more with the institutions and big whales playing the game more than half of the existing btc are in small hands in plenty of wallets 3 1 btc locking with on chain transparency holders can lock their btc in smart contracts for defined periods e g 2 5 or 10 years information about the locked btc will be public allowing the protocol s strength and its impact on reducing circulating supply to be demonstrated 3 2 incentive for holders btcu token to reward those who lock btc a native token btcu is issued based on the amount of btc locked and the staking duration the issuance of btcu is limited and deflationary to ensure its long term value distribution of btcu 1 btc locked for 2 years 100 btcu 1 btc locked for 5 years 250 btcu 1 btc locked for 10 years 600 btcu gradual distribution tokens are released progressively according to the lock duration to prevent market dumping 3 3 decentralized governance dao bcsp will be managed by the community through a dao system where btcu holders can vote on key decisions changes in staking parameters use of potential development funds implementation of new features 3 4 liquidity and flexibility to avoid liquidity loss for holders locked positions can be traded on a secondary p2p market btcu token can be used in defi as collateral on decentralized lending platforms security and regulation bcsp will be 100 decentralized and intermediary free with audited smart contracts to ensure security open source code allowing community verification no fixed return promises only incentives based on real supply and demand roadmap phase 1 development of the smart contract and testing on the testnet phase 2 launch of the protocol and initial staking phase 3 implementation of dao and decentralized governance phase 4 expansion of integrations with defi platforms phase 5 global growth and mass adoption conclusion the btc community staking protocol is the first initiative to unite btc holders in a collective effort free from whales and institutional manipulation the combination of transparent staking well designed incentives and decentralized governance could mark a turning point in the crypto ecosystem making us the mayority the ones with the control over it and not them,0.5203088383838383,2025-02-10 02:00

btc,Looking for Ideas: Charging Credit Cards & Converting to Crypto Without Fund Freezing,"I'm exploring ways to charge a customer’s credit card while receiving Bitcoin (BTC) or stablecoins (USDT, USDC) instead—mainly to prevent chargebacks since crypto transactions are irreversible.

I've heard that some crypto payment processors allow credit card payments and auto-convert them into crypto, but I also want to avoid account freezing issues. I’ve seen platforms like CoinGate and similar services freeze funds, so I want to ensure that once I charge a customer, I can immediately withdraw the money to prevent any risks.

I’d love to hear from others:

✅ What are the best platforms or services for this?  
✅ How can I avoid account freezing and ensure smooth withdrawals?  
✅ Are there any legal or compliance considerations?  
✅ What challenges should I expect, and how can they be handled?
