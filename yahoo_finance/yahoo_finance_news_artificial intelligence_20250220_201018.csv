"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025. Attendees will have the first opportunity to witness HERO's capabilities in action and explore its potential to reshape the security landscape. Further details regarding functionality, demonstrations and availability will be shared in subsequent announcements. AITX, through its primary subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc.

Unlike legacy video monitoring which requires costly personnel to passively watch video feeds, SARA autonomously responds to developing situations, deterring unauthorized access and instantly notifying management of security breaches. By eliminating the need for expensive monitoring centers and on-site security staff, SARA delivers significant cost savings while ensuring incidents are addressed without delay. This intelligent, automated approach provides a faster, more coordinated reaction to security threats at a fraction of the cost of traditional security operations. Tow yards and vehicle storage facilities are frequent targets for unauthorized access attempts, often by individuals trying to retrieve impounded vehicles without proper authorization. These facilities face ongoing security challenges, from break-ins to vandalism. Implementing advanced security solutions like RAD's RIO 360 provides a proactive deterrent, helping to prevent unauthorized access while ensuring the safety and integrity of stored vehicles. ""In last week's video update, I mentioned how RAD's sales cycles are accelerating, and this order is evidence of that,"" concluded Reinharz.

(RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCPK:AITX), continues to expand its presence in the healthcare industry, addressing growing security concerns with its AI-powered security solutions. A top-tier healthcare provider has now ordered 16 RIO 360 security towers for 12 sites, with plans to expand to 55 units across 23 locations in this initial deployment phase. These deployments strengthen RAD’s footprint in healthcare security, offering a proactive approach to protecting staff, patients, and facilities. From emergency rooms to parking lots, hospitals face an ever-growing set of security risks. Reports of violence against healthcare workers have surged, with threats coming from patients, visitors, and unauthorized individuals. Parking areas and entrances remain high-risk zones for theft, vandalism, and assaults. Many hospitals rely on security guards and traditional surveillance cameras, but these approaches are proving insufficient. Staffing shortages make it difficult to maintain a visible security presence, and passive camera systems offer little deterrence against real-time threats. Hospitals deploying RAD’s security solutions are reporting significant improvements in safety and efficiency. These AI-powered systems provide continuous surveillance, automated deterrence, and real-time response capabilities while reducing the costs associated with human security teams. RIO™ 360 Security Towers provide solar-powered, AI-driven monitoring and deterrence, replacing outdated security systems with intelligent automation. ROSA™ Security Devices offer compact, AI-enabled security with real-time video, two-way communication, and threat detection. Hospitals are planning to install ROSA units in areas where full RIO systems may not be needed.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025. Attendees will have the first opportunity to witness HERO's capabilities in action and explore its potential to reshape the security landscape. Further details regarding functionality, demonstrations and availability will be shared in subsequent announcements. AITX, through its primary subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc.

By utilizing RAD's SARA AI Agent alongside RIO 360, the towing company gains real-time alerts and intelligent notifications without the need for costly on-site security personnel. Unlike legacy video monitoring which requires costly personnel to passively watch video feeds, SARA autonomously responds to developing situations, deterring unauthorized access and instantly notifying management of security breaches. By eliminating the need for expensive monitoring centers and on-site security staff, SARA delivers significant cost savings while ensuring incidents are addressed without delay. This intelligent, automated approach provides a faster, more coordinated reaction to security threats at a fraction of the cost of traditional security operations. Tow yards and vehicle storage facilities are frequent targets for unauthorized access attempts, often by individuals trying to retrieve impounded vehicles without proper authorization. These facilities face ongoing security challenges, from break-ins to vandalism. Implementing advanced security solutions like RAD's RIO 360 provides a proactive deterrent, helping to prevent unauthorized access while ensuring the safety and integrity of stored vehicles. ""In last week's video update, I mentioned how RAD's sales cycles are accelerating, and this order is evidence of that,"" concluded Reinharz. ""Our expanded sales and marketing efforts are reaching the right prospects at the right time. We're seeing more leads come in already understanding the value of RAD's solutions, and they're eager to move forward at first contact.

(RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCPK:AITX), continues to expand its presence in the healthcare industry, addressing growing security concerns with its AI-powered security solutions. A top-tier healthcare provider has now ordered 16 RIO 360 security towers for 12 sites, with plans to expand to 55 units across 23 locations in this initial deployment phase. These deployments strengthen RAD’s footprint in healthcare security, offering a proactive approach to protecting staff, patients, and facilities. From emergency rooms to parking lots, hospitals face an ever-growing set of security risks. Reports of violence against healthcare workers have surged, with threats coming from patients, visitors, and unauthorized individuals. Parking areas and entrances remain high-risk zones for theft, vandalism, and assaults. Many hospitals rely on security guards and traditional surveillance cameras, but these approaches are proving insufficient. Staffing shortages make it difficult to maintain a visible security presence, and passive camera systems offer little deterrence against real-time threats. Hospitals deploying RAD’s security solutions are reporting significant improvements in safety and efficiency. These AI-powered systems provide continuous surveillance, automated deterrence, and real-time response capabilities while reducing the costs associated with human security teams. RIO™ 360 Security Towers provide solar-powered, AI-driven monitoring and deterrence, replacing outdated security systems with intelligent automation. ROSA™ Security Devices offer compact, AI-enabled security with real-time video, two-way communication, and threat detection. Hospitals are planning to install ROSA units in areas where full RIO systems may not be needed. RAD Light My Way™ is a mobile security escort solution that allows hospital staff to request monitored escorts from their smartphones, improving safety for employees walking to and from parking areas. Scotland Memorial Hospital has already deployed this system with strong results. Real-World Deployments Show Immediate Impact Scotland Memorial Hospital has seen measurable improvements since implementing RAD Light My Way. The system allows staff to request security escorts and real-time monitoring, strengthening the hospital’s security while providing peace of mind for employees. “This is more than just surveillance,” said Mark Folmer, CPP, PSP, FSyI, President of RAD. “Hospitals need proactive security that stops incidents before they escalate. Our AI-driven solutions provide a visible deterrent, immediate response capabilities, and significant cost savings compared to traditional security models.” With interest in AI-powered security growing, RAD is in active discussions with several major healthcare providers for both RAD’s stationary and mobile solutions. These organizations are exploring AI-based solutions to improve security in parking lots, protect staff, and reduce reliance on costly security guards. “Interest in ROAMEO™ Gen 4 throughout the healthcare industry is accelerating as hospitals and medical centers look for more effective ways to secure their properties,” added Folmer. “Large hospital parking lots have traditionally relied on security guards for patrols but staffing shortages and rising costs make that approach increasingly difficult to sustain. ROAMEO Gen 4 provides a powerful, mobile security solution that operates autonomously, delivers real-time monitoring, and enhances situational awareness, all while reducing reliance on expensive on-site personnel.” As more hospitals move toward intelligent automation for security, RAD continues to expand its presence in the healthcare sector, delivering technology that enhances safety while lowering costs.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025. Attendees will have the first opportunity to witness HERO's capabilities in action and explore its potential to reshape the security landscape. Further details regarding functionality, demonstrations and availability will be shared in subsequent announcements. AITX, through its primary subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc.

By utilizing RAD's SARA AI Agent alongside RIO 360, the towing company gains real-time alerts and intelligent notifications without the need for costly on-site security personnel. Unlike legacy video monitoring which requires costly personnel to passively watch video feeds, SARA autonomously responds to developing situations, deterring unauthorized access and instantly notifying management of security breaches. By eliminating the need for expensive monitoring centers and on-site security staff, SARA delivers significant cost savings while ensuring incidents are addressed without delay. This intelligent, automated approach provides a faster, more coordinated reaction to security threats at a fraction of the cost of traditional security operations. Tow yards and vehicle storage facilities are frequent targets for unauthorized access attempts, often by individuals trying to retrieve impounded vehicles without proper authorization. These facilities face ongoing security challenges, from break-ins to vandalism. Implementing advanced security solutions like RAD's RIO 360 provides a proactive deterrent, helping to prevent unauthorized access while ensuring the safety and integrity of stored vehicles. ""In last week's video update, I mentioned how RAD's sales cycles are accelerating, and this order is evidence of that,"" concluded Reinharz. ""Our expanded sales and marketing efforts are reaching the right prospects at the right time. We're seeing more leads come in already understanding the value of RAD's solutions, and they're eager to move forward at first contact. This momentum is a direct result of the work we've put into building awareness and demonstrating the real-world impact of our technology.""

AITX’s RAD Helps Hospitals Confront Escalating Security Threats with AI-Powered Protection,GlobeNewswire,2025-02-03 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-rad-helps-hospitals-confront-134000500.html,STORY,"Detroit, Michigan, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCPK:AITX), continues to expand its presence in the healthcare industry, addressing growing security concerns with its AI-powered security solutions. A top-tier healthcare provider has now ordered 16 RIO 360 security towers for 12 sites, with plans to expand to 55 units across 23 locations in this initial deployment phase. These deployments strengthen RAD’s footprint in healthcare security, offering a proactive approach to protecting staff, patients, and facilities. From emergency rooms to parking lots, hospitals face an ever-growing set of security risks. Reports of violence against healthcare workers have surged, with threats coming from patients, visitors, and unauthorized individuals. Parking areas and entrances remain high-risk zones for theft, vandalism, and assaults. Many hospitals rely on security guards and traditional surveillance cameras, but these approaches are proving insufficient. Staffing shortages make it difficult to maintain a visible security presence, and passive camera systems offer little deterrence against real-time threats. Hospitals deploying RAD’s security solutions are reporting significant improvements in safety and efficiency. These AI-powered systems provide continuous surveillance, automated deterrence, and real-time response capabilities while reducing the costs associated with human security teams. RIO™ 360 Security Towers provide solar-powered, AI-driven monitoring and deterrence, replacing outdated security systems with intelligent automation. ROSA™ Security Devices offer compact, AI-enabled security with real-time video, two-way communication, and threat detection. Hospitals are planning to install ROSA units in areas where full RIO systems may not be needed. RAD Light My Way™ is a mobile security escort solution that allows hospital staff to request monitored escorts from their smartphones, improving safety for employees walking to and from parking areas. Scotland Memorial Hospital has already deployed this system with strong results. Real-World Deployments Show Immediate Impact Scotland Memorial Hospital has seen measurable improvements since implementing RAD Light My Way. The system allows staff to request security escorts and real-time monitoring, strengthening the hospital’s security while providing peace of mind for employees. “This is more than just surveillance,” said Mark Folmer, CPP, PSP, FSyI, President of RAD. “Hospitals need proactive security that stops incidents before they escalate. Our AI-driven solutions provide a visible deterrent, immediate response capabilities, and significant cost savings compared to traditional security models.” With interest in AI-powered security growing, RAD is in active discussions with several major healthcare providers for both RAD’s stationary and mobile solutions. These organizations are exploring AI-based solutions to improve security in parking lots, protect staff, and reduce reliance on costly security guards. “Interest in ROAMEO™ Gen 4 throughout the healthcare industry is accelerating as hospitals and medical centers look for more effective ways to secure their properties,” added Folmer. “Large hospital parking lots have traditionally relied on security guards for patrols but staffing shortages and rising costs make that approach increasingly difficult to sustain. ROAMEO Gen 4 provides a powerful, mobile security solution that operates autonomously, delivers real-time monitoring, and enhances situational awareness, all while reducing reliance on expensive on-site personnel.” As more hospitals move toward intelligent automation for security, RAD continues to expand its presence in the healthcare sector, delivering technology that enhances safety while lowering costs.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April. Artist's depiction of a commercially available HERO, the humanoid security robot. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5243/241591_aitximg1.jpg HERO, in development by AITX's subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025.

Hospitals are planning to install ROSA units in areas where full RIO systems may not be needed. RAD Light My Way™ is a mobile security escort solution that allows hospital staff to request monitored escorts from their smartphones, improving safety for employees walking to and from parking areas. Scotland Memorial Hospital has already deployed this system with strong results. Real-World Deployments Show Immediate Impact Scotland Memorial Hospital has seen measurable improvements since implementing RAD Light My Way. The system allows staff to request security escorts and real-time monitoring, strengthening the hospital’s security while providing peace of mind for employees. “This is more than just surveillance,” said Mark Folmer, CPP, PSP, FSyI, President of RAD. “Hospitals need proactive security that stops incidents before they escalate. Our AI-driven solutions provide a visible deterrent, immediate response capabilities, and significant cost savings compared to traditional security models.” With interest in AI-powered security growing, RAD is in active discussions with several major healthcare providers for both RAD’s stationary and mobile solutions. These organizations are exploring AI-based solutions to improve security in parking lots, protect staff, and reduce reliance on costly security guards. “Interest in ROAMEO™ Gen 4 throughout the healthcare industry is accelerating as hospitals and medical centers look for more effective ways to secure their properties,” added Folmer. “Large hospital parking lots have traditionally relied on security guards for patrols but staffing shortages and rising costs make that approach increasingly difficult to sustain. ROAMEO Gen 4 provides a powerful, mobile security solution that operates autonomously, delivers real-time monitoring, and enhances situational awareness, all while reducing reliance on expensive on-site personnel.” As more hospitals move toward intelligent automation for security, RAD continues to expand its presence in the healthcare sector, delivering technology that enhances safety while lowering costs.

"AITX Announces HERO, the Humanoid Robot Addition to RAD's Safety & Security Solutions Lineup",Newsfile,2025-02-20 14:40:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aitx-announces-hero-humanoid-robot-134000275.html,STORY,"HERO to be Driven by SARA Providing Fully Autonomous Operations Detroit, Michigan--(Newsfile Corp. - February 20, 2025) - Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: AITX) (the ""Company""), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today announced the development of HERO™ (Humanoid Enforcement & Response Officer), an advanced humanoid security robot engineered to further expand the physical forms in which RAD delivers safety and security functionality. HERO joins the RAD hardware family that includes the award-winning ROSA™, RIO™, AVA™, TOM and ROAMEO™. HERO will make its public debut at ISC West in Las Vegas this April.

(RAD-M), could be commercially available towards the end of 2025. HERO is powered by RAD's hardware and software suite, as are the Company's other mobile solutions, including RADDOG LE2™ and ROAMEO, via its RAD electronics vest and backpack. This enables that RAD's core software for SARA™, response options, and mobility functionality are fully compatible with all other RAD devices making start up time and operational effectiveness quick and easy for clients. RAD-M is expected to bring HERO to market quickly, and at little cost, as the bulk of the software and has already been tested and proven on other mobile devices. One of AITX's strategic goals is to develop portable autonomous packs as shown on HERO and RADDOG, allowing for cost-efficient development for new hardware. HERO Applications HERO is designed to address the human preference of engaging humanoid-type form factors. While the balance of RAD's product set are purpose-built devices designed to reduce human labor and increase cost efficiency for specific duties related to safety and security, HERO packages these functional abilities in a more approachable or intimidating, depending on what is happening, demeanor. This form is expected to encourage high compliance with facility rules as well as provide additional de-escalation benefits that a non-humanoid form cannot offer. Human security officer roles are often underappreciated, poorly compensated, and carry an element of physical and verbal abuse risk. Compounded by rising labor costs, high turnover rates, and shortages of qualified security personnel have left many organizations struggling to maintain effective coverage. HERO offers a reliable alternative by providing consistent, around-the-clock security operations without the financial burden associated with staffing, training, and employee benefits. ""HERO is a continuation of AITX's mission to improve safety, security and efficiency while under cost pressures, exactly as the market is demanding,"" said Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX. ""When ready for commercial deployment, we will have further solidified our offering as having unmatched utility through both our software and hardware."" Technology Built for Real-World Applications HERO, like all RAD solutions, is being engineered to interact naturally with individuals. Much like a human security officer, HERO can provide de-escalation through its presence and conduct, perform access control duties, issue verbal warnings, and escalate incidents as needed via its immediate connection through SARA (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent). Furthermore, verified recipients of SARA telephone calls will be able to verbally direct HERO remotely. Its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time allows it to recognize potential threats and respond appropriately, significantly improving response times, reducing reliance on human intervention and lowering costs when compared to legacy solutions. Solutions developed by RAD-M are marketed and distributed by AITX subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc., and through RAD's extensive network of channel partners. This structure ensures that innovations like HERO reach a broad market efficiently, providing businesses and organizations with access to advanced, AI-driven security solutions backed by a trusted ecosystem of industry professionals. Unveiling at ISC West 2025 HERO will be formally introduced to the security industry at ISC West, the premier global security conference, taking place in Las Vegas from March 31 - April 4, 2025. Attendees will have the first opportunity to witness HERO's capabilities in action and explore its potential to reshape the security landscape. Further details regarding functionality, demonstrations and availability will be shared in subsequent announcements. AITX, through its primary subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc.
