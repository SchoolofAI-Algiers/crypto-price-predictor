        "content": "Elon Musk and Bill Gates don't exactly have the warmest relationship, and a certain Porsche purchase didn't help. After Gates revealed he had bought a Porsche Taycan instead of a Tesla, Musk responded with a blunt post on X in February 2020: \"My conversations with Gates have been underwhelming tbh.\" Gates shared his EV choice in an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, where he acknowledged Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA)  major role in pushing electric vehicles forward. He admitted that while EVs still have some drawbacks, especially in range, passenger cars are \"one of the most hopeful\" ways to make sustainable transportation more accessible. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends That being said, Gates opted for a Porsche Taycan, which he described as \"very very cool.\" He didn't specify which model, but the Taycan Turbo starts at $150,900, while the high-performance Turbo S goes for $185,000. The Turbo S boasts 750 horsepower and can hit 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds—so clearly, he wanted speed and luxury. Musk made the \"underwhelming\" comment in response to a post from Tesletter that read: \"I wonder why Bill Gates decided to go with the Taycan instead of a Tesla.\" Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Musk's reaction wasn't exactly surprising. He has a history of publicly challenging fellow tech billionaires—whether it's taking jabs at Mark Zuckerberg's AI expertise, feuding with Jeff Bezos over space travel, or clashing with Gates over Tesla stock. The Tesla CEO was especially frustrated when it surfaced that Gates had shorted Tesla stock, essentially betting against the company's success. In leaked text messages from 2022, Musk even rejected a potential philanthropic collaboration with Gates, saying, \"Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla.\" See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Despite the friction, Gates hasn't ruled out collaborating with Musk. In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Gates acknowledged their rocky history but still praised Musk's achievements. \"He's been nice to me at times, and mean to me at times,\" Gates said. \"I will try and work with him because he's brilliant, he's rich, he's influential.\" The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder also recognized Tesla's impact: \"I'm in awe of the great work he did at SpaceX and Tesla. The fact that Tesla kind of forced the car industry to do great EVs is a gigantic contribution,\" Gates said. While Gates and Musk have found common ground—like philanthropy and advancing tech—they clearly have their differences. Gates was once the world's richest person for a record 18 years, while Musk took the top spot in 2021. Their rivalry might not be personal, but it's definitely entertaining.

        "content": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump said it would be unfair for Tesla (TSLA, Financials) to establish a manufacturing plant in India, citing the country's high import tariffs on electric vehicles. India charges import taxes of up to 100% on electric cars in order to safeguard home companies like Tata Motors. But under a new rule, businesses may pay a lowered 15% tax if they spend at least $500 million and establish a manufacturing facility here. Beginning its expansion in India, Tesla has chosen sites for showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai and posted mid-level employment openings. The corporation has not started domestic production yet. Frequent opponent of world trade policy, Trump reaffirmed his belief that other countries levy unfair taxes on American products. He recommended that the United States apply reciprocal tariffs on nations taxing American goods. His remarks raise questions over rising trade tensions as they indicate a possible change in trade policy should he get back to power. The idea for reciprocal taxes may sour ties with both economic adversaries and friends. The Indian foreign ministry has not officially reacted to Trump's comments.

        "content": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla. Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes. U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, cited the FSD investigation and noted that the technology does not make vehicles self-driving and that human drivers must remain attentive. \"There's a history of Tesla misleading consumers regarding what that technology is actually capable of doing and unfortunately that has led to deaths as a result of it,\" Peters said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peters noted that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to Trump, and has previously criticized NHTSA's regulatory efforts. Musk is currently overseeing the Trump administration push to significantly shrink the federal government. Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a key Tesla safety probe would continue. In January, NHTSA opened a separate probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely. Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. The agency is still investigating whether that recall is adequate to address concerns that drivers are not paying attention. Last week, Trump nominated an Apple lawyer to head NHTSA. Jonathan Morrison, who served as chief counsel of NHTSA during the first Trump administration, had previously worked for the California New Car Dealers The scrutiny of the advanced driver-assistance system comes as Musk looks to pivot toward self-driving technology and robotaxis.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Buzzing on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. Investors are continuing to assess the impact of new LLMs in the AI industry. X. Eyeé, CEO of AI consulting firm Malo Santo and senior policy advisor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, said in a recent program on CNBC that the DeepSeek breakthrough in China has changed the dynamics of the AI race. She believes AI development is no longer limited to the companies with the “largest pockets.” “I mean, the world has long looked to the United States to be the leader in artificial intelligence, but these recent model releases from China have demonstrated its ability to leapfrog and catch up with us tech giants and achieve groundbreaking results without the luxury of advanced hardware, which is ultimately challenging everything that we thought was necessary for innovation in the AI space. See, what DeepSeek represents is that AI innovation isn’t necessarily driven by the companies with the largest pockets or the fanciest hardware, but that collaborative development approaches can actually end up providing market-leading technologies.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks making the biggest moves these days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hadrian / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 99 Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James,  said in a program on CNBC that Elon Musk might go “too far” with his powers and end up getting a “no” from President Donald Trump. “Elon Musk is going after individual senators, going after individual members, but there’s just not a lot of play there. So to me, if there is one pressure point that I am truly looking at, it’s if he goes too far—if he takes something and makes it very difficult for a member of Congress to win reelection. They just might be a “no,” and then Trump’s agenda is a “no.”” The analyst talked about Elon Musk’s attitude about business interests and what that might bring for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders: “I do think when you look at this, it’s exceptionally unusual that you have the President of the United States and Elon Musk, both having publicly traded companies that can be specifically targeted. As it relates to Elon Musk, you had the story about Starlink in Ottawa, but also, if there are direct tariffs, I don’t think that matters as much to Elon as it would to a shareholder. Elon has certainly kind of shrugged off the response to the SpaceX contract being canceled—that’s just kind of how he does business. His wealth is so vast that what would be painful to a Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder is not the same level of pain for Elon.” Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) detracted from performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stock had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, and our portfolio has an underweight position relative to the benchmark weight. Tesla reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings in late October. Given the CEO of Tesla’s position as an advisor to President-elect Trump, performance in the shares accelerated following the U.S. presidential election. There are expectations that regulation for autonomous driving will be centralized with the federal government. There have been reports in the press that tax incentives for electric vehicles will be eliminated or reduced, which could have a negative impact on Tesla’s subscale competitors.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder is not the same level of pain for Elon.” Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) detracted from performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stock had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, and our portfolio has an underweight position relative to the benchmark weight. Tesla reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings in late October. Given the CEO of Tesla’s position as an advisor to President-elect Trump, performance in the shares accelerated following the U.S. presidential election. There are expectations that regulation for autonomous driving will be centralized with the federal government. There have been reports in the press that tax incentives for electric vehicles will be eliminated or reduced, which could have a negative impact on Tesla’s subscale competitors.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "content": "Elon Musk and Bill Gates don't exactly have the warmest relationship, and a certain Porsche purchase didn't help. After Gates revealed he had bought a Porsche Taycan instead of a Tesla, Musk responded with a blunt post on X in February 2020: \"My conversations with Gates have been underwhelming tbh.\" Gates shared his EV choice in an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, where he acknowledged Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA)  major role in pushing electric vehicles forward. He admitted that while EVs still have some drawbacks, especially in range, passenger cars are \"one of the most hopeful\" ways to make sustainable transportation more accessible. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends That being said, Gates opted for a Porsche Taycan, which he described as \"very very cool.\" He didn't specify which model, but the Taycan Turbo starts at $150,900, while the high-performance Turbo S goes for $185,000. The Turbo S boasts 750 horsepower and can hit 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds—so clearly, he wanted speed and luxury. Musk made the \"underwhelming\" comment in response to a post from Tesletter that read: \"I wonder why Bill Gates decided to go with the Taycan instead of a Tesla.\" Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Musk's reaction wasn't exactly surprising. He has a history of publicly challenging fellow tech billionaires—whether it's taking jabs at Mark Zuckerberg's AI expertise, feuding with Jeff Bezos over space travel, or clashing with Gates over Tesla stock. The Tesla CEO was especially frustrated when it surfaced that Gates had shorted Tesla stock, essentially betting against the company's success. In leaked text messages from 2022, Musk even rejected a potential philanthropic collaboration with Gates, saying, \"Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla.\" See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Despite the friction, Gates hasn't ruled out collaborating with Musk. In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Gates acknowledged their rocky history but still praised Musk's achievements. \"He's been nice to me at times, and mean to me at times,\" Gates said. \"I will try and work with him because he's brilliant, he's rich, he's influential.\" The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder also recognized Tesla's impact: \"I'm in awe of the great work he did at SpaceX and Tesla. The fact that Tesla kind of forced the car industry to do great EVs is a gigantic contribution,\" Gates said. While Gates and Musk have found common ground—like philanthropy and advancing tech—they clearly have their differences. Gates was once the world's richest person for a record 18 years, while Musk took the top spot in 2021. Their rivalry might not be personal, but it's definitely entertaining.

India charges import taxes of up to 100% on electric cars in order to safeguard home companies like Tata Motors. But under a new rule, businesses may pay a lowered 15% tax if they spend at least $500 million and establish a manufacturing facility here.

He recommended that the United States apply reciprocal tariffs on nations taxing American goods. His remarks raise questions over rising trade tensions as they indicate a possible change in trade policy should he get back to power.

        "content": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla. Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes. U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, cited the FSD investigation and noted that the technology does not make vehicles self-driving and that human drivers must remain attentive. \"There's a history of Tesla misleading consumers regarding what that technology is actually capable of doing and unfortunately that has led to deaths as a result of it,\" Peters said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peters noted that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to Trump, and has previously criticized NHTSA's regulatory efforts. Musk is currently overseeing the Trump administration push to significantly shrink the federal government. Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a key Tesla safety probe would continue. In January, NHTSA opened a separate probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely. Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. The agency is still investigating whether that recall is adequate to address concerns that drivers are not paying attention. Last week, Trump nominated an Apple lawyer to head NHTSA. Jonathan Morrison, who served as chief counsel of NHTSA during the first Trump administration, had previously worked for the California New Car Dealers The scrutiny of the advanced driver-assistance system comes as Musk looks to pivot toward self-driving technology and robotaxis.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. Investors are continuing to assess the impact of new LLMs in the AI industry. X. Eyeé, CEO of AI consulting firm Malo Santo and senior policy advisor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, said in a recent program on CNBC that the DeepSeek breakthrough in China has changed the dynamics of the AI race. She believes AI development is no longer limited to the companies with the “largest pockets.” “I mean, the world has long looked to the United States to be the leader in artificial intelligence, but these recent model releases from China have demonstrated its ability to leapfrog and catch up with us tech giants and achieve groundbreaking results without the luxury of advanced hardware, which is ultimately challenging everything that we thought was necessary for innovation in the AI space. See, what DeepSeek represents is that AI innovation isn’t necessarily driven by the companies with the largest pockets or the fanciest hardware, but that collaborative development approaches can actually end up providing market-leading technologies.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks making the biggest moves these days.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hadrian / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 99 Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James,  said in a program on CNBC that Elon Musk might go “too far” with his powers and end up getting a “no” from President Donald Trump. “Elon Musk is going after individual senators, going after individual members, but there’s just not a lot of play there. So to me, if there is one pressure point that I am truly looking at, it’s if he goes too far—if he takes something and makes it very difficult for a member of Congress to win reelection. They just might be a “no,” and then Trump’s agenda is a “no.”” The analyst talked about Elon Musk’s attitude about business interests and what that might bring for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders: “I do think when you look at this, it’s exceptionally unusual that you have the President of the United States and Elon Musk, both having publicly traded companies that can be specifically targeted. As it relates to Elon Musk, you had the story about Starlink in Ottawa, but also, if there are direct tariffs, I don’t think that matters as much to Elon as it would to a shareholder.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes. U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, cited the FSD investigation and noted that the technology does not make vehicles self-driving and that human drivers must remain attentive. \"There's a history of Tesla misleading consumers regarding what that technology is actually capable of doing and unfortunately that has led to deaths as a result of it,\" Peters said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peters noted that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to Trump, and has previously criticized NHTSA's regulatory efforts. Musk is currently overseeing the Trump administration push to significantly shrink the federal government. Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a key Tesla safety probe would continue. In January, NHTSA opened a separate probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely. Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. The agency is still investigating whether that recall is adequate to address concerns that drivers are not paying attention. Last week, Trump nominated an Apple lawyer to head NHTSA. Jonathan Morrison, who served as chief counsel of NHTSA during the first Trump administration, had previously worked for the California New Car Dealers The scrutiny of the advanced driver-assistance system comes as Musk looks to pivot toward self-driving technology and robotaxis.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Buzzing on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. Investors are continuing to assess the impact of new LLMs in the AI industry. X. Eyeé, CEO of AI consulting firm Malo Santo and senior policy advisor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, said in a recent program on CNBC that the DeepSeek breakthrough in China has changed the dynamics of the AI race. She believes AI development is no longer limited to the companies with the “largest pockets.” “I mean, the world has long looked to the United States to be the leader in artificial intelligence, but these recent model releases from China have demonstrated its ability to leapfrog and catch up with us tech giants and achieve groundbreaking results without the luxury of advanced hardware, which is ultimately challenging everything that we thought was necessary for innovation in the AI space. See, what DeepSeek represents is that AI innovation isn’t necessarily driven by the companies with the largest pockets or the fanciest hardware, but that collaborative development approaches can actually end up providing market-leading technologies.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks making the biggest moves these days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hadrian / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 99 Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James,  said in a program on CNBC that Elon Musk might go “too far” with his powers and end up getting a “no” from President Donald Trump. “Elon Musk is going after individual senators, going after individual members, but there’s just not a lot of play there. So to me, if there is one pressure point that I am truly looking at, it’s if he goes too far—if he takes something and makes it very difficult for a member of Congress to win reelection. They just might be a “no,” and then Trump’s agenda is a “no.”” The analyst talked about Elon Musk’s attitude about business interests and what that might bring for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders: “I do think when you look at this, it’s exceptionally unusual that you have the President of the United States and Elon Musk, both having publicly traded companies that can be specifically targeted. As it relates to Elon Musk, you had the story about Starlink in Ottawa, but also, if there are direct tariffs, I don’t think that matters as much to Elon as it would to a shareholder. Elon has certainly kind of shrugged off the response to the SpaceX contract being canceled—that’s just kind of how he does business. His wealth is so vast that what would be painful to a Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder is not the same level of pain for Elon.” Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) detracted from performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stock had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, and our portfolio has an underweight position relative to the benchmark weight. Tesla reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings in late October. Given the CEO of Tesla’s position as an advisor to President-elect Trump, performance in the shares accelerated following the U.S. presidential election. There are expectations that regulation for autonomous driving will be centralized with the federal government. There have been reports in the press that tax incentives for electric vehicles will be eliminated or reduced, which could have a negative impact on Tesla’s subscale competitors.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "content": "Elon Musk and Bill Gates don't exactly have the warmest relationship, and a certain Porsche purchase didn't help. After Gates revealed he had bought a Porsche Taycan instead of a Tesla, Musk responded with a blunt post on X in February 2020: \"My conversations with Gates have been underwhelming tbh.\" Gates shared his EV choice in an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, where he acknowledged Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA)  major role in pushing electric vehicles forward. He admitted that while EVs still have some drawbacks, especially in range, passenger cars are \"one of the most hopeful\" ways to make sustainable transportation more accessible. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends That being said, Gates opted for a Porsche Taycan, which he described as \"very very cool.\" He didn't specify which model, but the Taycan Turbo starts at $150,900, while the high-performance Turbo S goes for $185,000. The Turbo S boasts 750 horsepower and can hit 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds—so clearly, he wanted speed and luxury. Musk made the \"underwhelming\" comment in response to a post from Tesletter that read: \"I wonder why Bill Gates decided to go with the Taycan instead of a Tesla.\" Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Musk's reaction wasn't exactly surprising. He has a history of publicly challenging fellow tech billionaires—whether it's taking jabs at Mark Zuckerberg's AI expertise, feuding with Jeff Bezos over space travel, or clashing with Gates over Tesla stock. The Tesla CEO was especially frustrated when it surfaced that Gates had shorted Tesla stock, essentially betting against the company's success. In leaked text messages from 2022, Musk even rejected a potential philanthropic collaboration with Gates, saying, \"Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla.\" See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Despite the friction, Gates hasn't ruled out collaborating with Musk. In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Gates acknowledged their rocky history but still praised Musk's achievements. \"He's been nice to me at times, and mean to me at times,\" Gates said. \"I will try and work with him because he's brilliant, he's rich, he's influential.\" The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder also recognized Tesla's impact: \"I'm in awe of the great work he did at SpaceX and Tesla. The fact that Tesla kind of forced the car industry to do great EVs is a gigantic contribution,\" Gates said. While Gates and Musk have found common ground—like philanthropy and advancing tech—they clearly have their differences. Gates was once the world's richest person for a record 18 years, while Musk took the top spot in 2021. Their rivalry might not be personal, but it's definitely entertaining.

India charges import taxes of up to 100% on electric cars in order to safeguard home companies like Tata Motors. But under a new rule, businesses may pay a lowered 15% tax if they spend at least $500 million and establish a manufacturing facility here. Beginning its expansion in India, Tesla has chosen sites for showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai and posted mid-level employment openings. The corporation has not started domestic production yet. Frequent opponent of world trade policy, Trump reaffirmed his belief that other countries levy unfair taxes on American products. He recommended that the United States apply reciprocal tariffs on nations taxing American goods. His remarks raise questions over rising trade tensions as they indicate a possible change in trade policy should he get back to power. The idea for reciprocal taxes may sour ties with both economic adversaries and friends. The Indian foreign ministry has not officially reacted to Trump's comments.

These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends That being said, Gates opted for a Porsche Taycan, which he described as \"very very cool.\" He didn't specify which model, but the Taycan Turbo starts at $150,900, while the high-performance Turbo S goes for $185,000. The Turbo S boasts 750 horsepower and can hit 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds—so clearly, he wanted speed and luxury. Musk made the \"underwhelming\" comment in response to a post from Tesletter that read: \"I wonder why Bill Gates decided to go with the Taycan instead of a Tesla.\" Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Musk's reaction wasn't exactly surprising. He has a history of publicly challenging fellow tech billionaires—whether it's taking jabs at Mark Zuckerberg's AI expertise, feuding with Jeff Bezos over space travel, or clashing with Gates over Tesla stock. The Tesla CEO was especially frustrated when it surfaced that Gates had shorted Tesla stock, essentially betting against the company's success. In leaked text messages from 2022, Musk even rejected a potential philanthropic collaboration with Gates, saying, \"Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla.\" See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Despite the friction, Gates hasn't ruled out collaborating with Musk. In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Gates acknowledged their rocky history but still praised Musk's achievements. \"He's been nice to me at times, and mean to me at times,\" Gates said. \"I will try and work with him because he's brilliant, he's rich, he's influential.\" The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder also recognized Tesla's impact: \"I'm in awe of the great work he did at SpaceX and Tesla. The fact that Tesla kind of forced the car industry to do great EVs is a gigantic contribution,\" Gates said. While Gates and Musk have found common ground—like philanthropy and advancing tech—they clearly have their differences. Gates was once the world's richest person for a record 18 years, while Musk took the top spot in 2021. Their rivalry might not be personal, but it's definitely entertaining.

        "content": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump said it would be unfair for Tesla (TSLA, Financials) to establish a manufacturing plant in India, citing the country's high import tariffs on electric vehicles. India charges import taxes of up to 100% on electric cars in order to safeguard home companies like Tata Motors. But under a new rule, businesses may pay a lowered 15% tax if they spend at least $500 million and establish a manufacturing facility here. Beginning its expansion in India, Tesla has chosen sites for showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai and posted mid-level employment openings. The corporation has not started domestic production yet. Frequent opponent of world trade policy, Trump reaffirmed his belief that other countries levy unfair taxes on American products. He recommended that the United States apply reciprocal tariffs on nations taxing American goods. His remarks raise questions over rising trade tensions as they indicate a possible change in trade policy should he get back to power. The idea for reciprocal taxes may sour ties with both economic adversaries and friends. The Indian foreign ministry has not officially reacted to Trump's comments.

        "content": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla. Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other open safety probes. U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, cited the FSD investigation and noted that the technology does not make vehicles self-driving and that human drivers must remain attentive. \"There's a history of Tesla misleading consumers regarding what that technology is actually capable of doing and unfortunately that has led to deaths as a result of it,\" Peters said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peters noted that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to Trump, and has previously criticized NHTSA's regulatory efforts. Musk is currently overseeing the Trump administration push to significantly shrink the federal government. Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a key Tesla safety probe would continue. In January, NHTSA opened a separate probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely. Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system. The agency is still investigating whether that recall is adequate to address concerns that drivers are not paying attention. Last week, Trump nominated an Apple lawyer to head NHTSA. Jonathan Morrison, who served as chief counsel of NHTSA during the first Trump administration, had previously worked for the California New Car Dealers The scrutiny of the advanced driver-assistance system comes as Musk looks to pivot toward self-driving technology and robotaxis.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Buzzing on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. Investors are continuing to assess the impact of new LLMs in the AI industry. X. Eyeé, CEO of AI consulting firm Malo Santo and senior policy advisor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, said in a recent program on CNBC that the DeepSeek breakthrough in China has changed the dynamics of the AI race. She believes AI development is no longer limited to the companies with the “largest pockets.” “I mean, the world has long looked to the United States to be the leader in artificial intelligence, but these recent model releases from China have demonstrated its ability to leapfrog and catch up with us tech giants and achieve groundbreaking results without the luxury of advanced hardware, which is ultimately challenging everything that we thought was necessary for innovation in the AI space. See, what DeepSeek represents is that AI innovation isn’t necessarily driven by the companies with the largest pockets or the fanciest hardware, but that collaborative development approaches can actually end up providing market-leading technologies.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks making the biggest moves these days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hadrian / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 99 Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James,  said in a program on CNBC that Elon Musk might go “too far” with his powers and end up getting a “no” from President Donald Trump. “Elon Musk is going after individual senators, going after individual members, but there’s just not a lot of play there. So to me, if there is one pressure point that I am truly looking at, it’s if he goes too far—if he takes something and makes it very difficult for a member of Congress to win reelection. They just might be a “no,” and then Trump’s agenda is a “no.”” The analyst talked about Elon Musk’s attitude about business interests and what that might bring for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders: “I do think when you look at this, it’s exceptionally unusual that you have the President of the United States and Elon Musk, both having publicly traded companies that can be specifically targeted. As it relates to Elon Musk, you had the story about Starlink in Ottawa, but also, if there are direct tariffs, I don’t think that matters as much to Elon as it would to a shareholder. Elon has certainly kind of shrugged off the response to the SpaceX contract being canceled—that’s just kind of how he does business. His wealth is so vast that what would be painful to a Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder is not the same level of pain for Elon.” Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) detracted from performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stock had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, and our portfolio has an underweight position relative to the benchmark weight. Tesla reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings in late October. Given the CEO of Tesla’s position as an advisor to President-elect Trump, performance in the shares accelerated following the U.S. presidential election. There are expectations that regulation for autonomous driving will be centralized with the federal government. There have been reports in the press that tax incentives for electric vehicles will be eliminated or reduced, which could have a negative impact on Tesla’s subscale competitors.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks buzzing on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
